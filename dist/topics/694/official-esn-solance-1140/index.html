<p>On the ninth day of ESN, empaths gained access to a new spell... Solace (1140)!</p>

<p>Solace can be used to IMPRINT a player in the same realm as an auto-success and no spirit cost. It grants 3 + (Mental Lore, Trensference Bonus / 50) charges and lasts the standard imprint duration. Mental Lore, Transference also increases the range of Solace to adjacent realm at 35 ranks, near-adjacent at 70 ranks, and far at 105 ranks. Finally, for 30 seconds after the casting of Solace, the empath can transfer from that player regardless of whether they are "in combat" or not.</p>

<p>Solace has a 60 minute cooldown which can be reduced by 12 seconds for every rank of Spiritual Lore, Blessings.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) In this context, does the word "charge" mean how many individual wounds may be transferred before the imprint is broken?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) When I cast solace, do I cast it AT a person or do I cast it on myself and then IMPRINT while its up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cast it AT the person, like you would use 116 or 225.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) Why does normal IMPRINT rely on healing skill check roll for charges (can you give us an idea of how many extra charges you get based on success?) instead of also using Transference bonus like the Solace spell does? (yes I know the success includes that lore but I'm curious why Solace uses Blessings specifically to provide additional charges)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMPRINT uses the roll for additional charges to help encourage and differentiate between each empath's focus on training in healing-specific skills/spell research. Solace doesn't have a roll, so I picked Transference to provide additional charges to add more benefits for this new lore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SWEET. Now how do I train my friends to get my attention?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMPRINT CALL is a good way as long as your on their imprinted list...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4) Is there any easy way in-game to know how much time is remaining on this cooldown? I haven't used it yet but I'm assuming there might be a spell effect on you when you're in cooldown?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There should be a spell effect for the cooldown that is easy to see in SPELL ACTIVE, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What a waste of a perfectly good spell slot :(</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's significantly better than what was in that spell slot for the last 9 years, which was nothing. And if we have a good idea for a profession, we almost never limited by having/not having a spell slot. The constraint is lack of good and balanced ideas, not empty spell slots.</p>

<p>Those who question the spell are probably not understanding the full implication of it. Empaths may have the ability to IMPRINT, but it's a skill check (which most empaths will probably only have a 35-50% chance to succeed at) and the target must be in the same room as the empath. Solace (1140) changes that dynamic. With enough lore, you can instantly imprint with guaranteed success and heal anyone in the game every hour. And even with no lore, anyone in the same realm. Now when little Timmy falls down the well in Wehnimer's Landing and calls out for help on the amulet, you can cast 1140 while resting in Ta'Illistim to imprint and heal him.</p>

<p>Assuming you have the spirit (and as a healing empath, you're probably on a node a good amount of time to mitigate the cost), there's very little reason not to try to IMPRINT on every target you heal.  Doing so helps give you the advantage on healing that player first if they get wounded again in their next few hunts (since you get notified once they receive wounds and are out of combat for 20 seconds).  It also a huge convenience for affected players since they might not have to end their hunt early and don't have to waste herbs or seek out a healer again.  There's no downside to using it.</p></div></article><article id="post-7668" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, November 28th, 2017, 10:23:27 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Idk, are we sure that empaths don't need to store up weeks of empathy* (a new power!) before they can extend their power out that far that frequently? maybe limit them to only using the ability once every few weeks or so is more in line with expectations.</p></div></article><article id="post-7673" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Larch</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, November 29th, 2017, 3:49:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@estild said in <a href="/post/7667">Official: ESN - Solance (1140)</a>:</p>

<p>Possibly, but if you already had your own heal bot you'd likely just go to it anyway once you were done hunting.</p></div></article><article id="post-7675" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, November 29th, 2017, 5:14:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@larch said in <a href="/post/7673">Official: ESN - Solance (1140)</a>:</p>

<p>I can see your argument, but conversely it provides the ability for healers to be distributed across several different places, instead of everyone being required to run to TSC (or equivalent) and yell, "any healing?".  </p>

<p>I haven't had the time yet to get in game this week to test it out, but I do think there should be a way to blacklist/whitelist healers from using <code>imprint</code>on you if there isn't one already.</p></div></article><article id="post-7687" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 30th, 2017, 6:52:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ondreian </p>
