There used to be no issue with getting epic deepening on these cloaks without changing the weight. Has this changed?</p>

<p>I had several other players say they've had these cloaks done earlier last week with no issue.  @Wyrom, any official word on this?</p>

<p>Whoever was behind Culd was very professional about it, and I appreciated his service.  He made sure to let me know before he increased the weight, and when the decision was revisited, he sent me word in game to come back.  I thought that was pretty solid.  @Wyrom, fyi.</p></div></article><article id="post-3590" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 27th, 2017, 11:52:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Culd was great.

<p>Exactly why I made sure to word my post the way I did on the officials.  I'm sure if I'd been an ass about it, Culd wouldn't have bothered reaching back out to me to re-offer the service.  And I don't know who was working the back channel in this instance, but @Wyrom props to whomever read my post and acted on it quickly.</p></div></article><article id="post-3653" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 1:29:07 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex said in <a href="/post/3623">Epic Deepening Changes - Weight increase to .5 lb cloaks</a>:</p>

<p>You say that, but I generally believe myself to be level-headed when dealing with merchants. If I'm told no, I usually apologize and offer up another option. I have been, on rare occasion, made to feel like I've done something wrong because I've asked for something that was once OK but is now illegal. I've also been told that a fair number of GMs used to find me difficult because my ideas were so "borderline." </p>

<p>This is frustrating because I don't consider my ideas to be so far out of line with alter guidelines and I've never asked for something I thought to myself "Oh man, I hope I can sneak this by the GM."</p>

<p>I'd absolutely <strong>love</strong> the opportunity to see what things have been considered OK and which ones no longer are. I think the last time was a few years ago when I asked for something "ombreed" and was told that while "ombre" was allowed, this version was not because it was "too modern." I never understood it, but revamped the idea to use the acceptable version.</p>

<p>I do disagree with people who argue with the GMs or complains/bitches at them. We're all adults and we should be capable of responding as such. I do not agree with the idea that every question asked about a design refusal is an argument. I also think that GMs should attempt to provide a reason why something is refused (something I've definitely seen an attempt to do more often in recent years, thank you!) so we can try to avoid the same issue in the future.</p>

<p>Anyway, ramble ramble ramble.</p></div></article><article id="post-3656" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 1:42:40 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@riend </p>
