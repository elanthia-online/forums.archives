<p>However, your concern has been noted, we will keep an eye on it.  But just as a point of clarification, we're likely not going go super moderation on a post-by-post basis, it's more if someone/something reaches a threshold where we (admins) feel we need to step in and start having discussions about someone, that actions will be taken.  I'll go ahead and say it's the pornography ruling of you know it when you see it.</p></div></article><article id="post-299" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">GSPlayer</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 9:46:48 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Posters have a tool next to Reply Quote - a drop down menu to either Bookmark or Flag a post for moderation.</p></div></article><article id="post-308" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 10:11:14 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This forum is moderated.

<p>I have a HUGE monitor, and run two browser windows side by side with a smattering of other windows peeking in the middle and around the side. </p>

<p>This feels like a very wide requirement for ... breadcrumbs.

<p>Unfortunately I agree trolls will likely wander over here as their audience in the other site dwindles. But I seriously doubt this group is going to tolerate any problems.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
