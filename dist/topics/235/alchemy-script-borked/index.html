<p>;alchemy auto alchemy    will go up to the task master and ends up getting a potions task, not an alchemy task and then just shits its pants and does nothing. Sometimes I can get it to do tasks but otherwise any sort of recipe prep or anything else related to alchemy tasks just doesn't work. I even renamed my .db3 file and reconfigured it and it did the same thing.</p>

<p>Yes, it takes some time to do all the calculations.</p>

<p>;alchemy auto</p>

<p>;alchemy auto general</p>

<p>;alchemy auto trinkets</p>

<p>;alchemy auto potions</p>

<p>Those are your options.</p></div></article><article id="post-2271" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 5:47:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>;alchemy task alchemy                      Attempt to complete one task in general alchemy.</p>

<p>Im not sure why that keeps triggering me, but its very much ;alchemy auto alchemy     to do general alchemy tasks for the version i have.
The massive delay only came about recently.</p></div></article><article id="post-2272" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 5:49:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim said in <a href="/post/2271">Alchemy script borked</a>:</p>

<p>Nevermind, I r wrong.</p>

<p>;alchemy auto <alchemy|potions|trinkets>   Only work on the given area(s).</p>

<p>I vaguely remember doing ;alchemy auto general though so maybe that's programmed in there as well.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
