Right now, I only see "Light" and "Dark" as the options on skins/themes.  While it's nice to be able to turn off the blinding white of doom, I'd really like if we had skins available to add more visual breaks.  I do not dig the current "undivided layouts" fad.</p>

<p>I believe they have the code for this, and it is in the works.</p>

<p>When you say the "undivided layout" - Are you talking about the light grey line between individual posters posts?</p></div></article><article id="post-192" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 12:09:49 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Nah, just the general UI approach.  On the top-level, there's no visual breaks between each forum, for instance.  Only for categories.  I'm not being sarcastic about it being all the rage in UI design, it's supposed to present a more "open" feel, but for a lot of people (myself included) it is not optimal.</p>

<p>I like things like alternating shading etc. because my eyes are trained to scan information based on visual breaks.  Without breaks, I have to read the text just to scan when navigating etc.</p></div></article><article id="post-195" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 12:17:11 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I would like: </p>

<p>It should, yes.  But if you can find the theme you like and are able to suggest it.  It's easier to add.</p></div></article><article id="post-201" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 12:33:36 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What software are we one (yes, I can probably dig it, but I am le lazy)</p></div></article><article id="post-203" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 12:36:02 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex said in <a href="/post/201">Additional Themes/Skins</a>:</p>

<p>This next weekend I am going to be looking at setting up a staging instance, so we can simultaneously work and experiment without affecting the live site, which will be better for everyone.</p></div></article><article id="post-384" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">GS4Menos</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 1:34:44 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ondreian </p>

<p>I don't know how anything works on the back end, but it would be really nice if there was some sort of slider or RGB box we could enter in to change the background color and text color.  I am one of those odd people who prefer to read everything as black on sepia vs the common choices of grey/dark grey, black/white and white/black.  I can pretty much deal with any board layout so long as the colors don't hurt my eyes.</p></div></article><article id="post-627" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 2:55:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>For someone stuck in 2012, I found this theme - It's got the oldstyle forum look but is a responsive template -</p>

<p>I'm fine with the dark theme here, but that looks like it could quell a lot of complaints about 'not understanding' the layout here.  Good find.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
