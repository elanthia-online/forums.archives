<p>Hah, I really dig stouts but I'm not a huge fan of bourbon ales.</p>

<p>My favorites are hefeweizens, belgians, pale ales, IPAs, and pilsners not necessarily in that order.  </p>

<p>That said, I'll drink basically whatever and be happy to have it.

<p>Agreed. I generally don't like IPAs, but Dog Fish Head seems to have more carbonation in their IPAs, and they taste good to me.</p></div></article><article id="post-784" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 8:12:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'll be honest.

Presto.</p>

<p>For those of us who live where rhubarb grows: pickle some, this stuff is gold.  Make whatever drink you want, add rhubarb, pickled or unpickled.  Muddle it if you don't pickle it especially, and maybe add some simple syrup to moderate the tartness.</p></div></article><article id="post-1911" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 6:40:40 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Also, I was at the Surly brewery last night.

<p>I'd imagine it's like a pre-made margarita mix.  It's just not the same unless you mix it yourself.</p></div></article><article id="post-1937" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Obsalyn</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 10:50:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm doing Absolut Wild Tea flavored with coke right now, cranberry juice is better but it's still pretty good</p></div></article><article id="post-1946" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Taernath</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 12:13:20 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archigeek said in <a href="/post/1910">Shawty, what you sippin&apos;?</a>:</p>

<p>I saw some rhubarb stuff in the craft beer section of my local liquor store.  Not sure if it was an IPA or whatever, but it struck me as odd.</p></div></article><article id="post-1964" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Parkbandit</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 9:17:25 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@viekn said in <a href="/post/1936">Shawty, what you sippin&apos;?</a>:</p>

<p>It's just different.  It's not a rum and root beer product, it's a craft beer that uses very little taste in the beer process (mostly malted barley) and then instead of hops and other typical craft beer additives, they add the vanilla and sarsaparilla for the root beer flavor.</p>

<p>Most have the same type of alcohol content that craft beer has.</p></div></article><article id="post-1965" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Parkbandit</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 9:19:03 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@taernath said in <a href="/post/1946">Shawty, what you sippin&apos;?</a>:</p>

<p>I had a rhubarb wheat ale that was pretty tasty.  More like a sour than a typical ale though.</p></div></article><article id="post-1974" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Naamit</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 11:17:52 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archigeek Let me know if you ever want to hit up Northbound Smokehouse Brewpub.</p></div></article><article id="post-2008" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 2:35:19 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@naamit The food is pretty decent there and t he beverages aren't bad.
