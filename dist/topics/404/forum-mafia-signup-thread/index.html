If there is a game that is actively seeking players, it'll be posted here.  Simply copy and paste (It's easier to copy and paste in this forum than quote, then go though and remove all the quote crap I've found) and add your name to it.  When the game is done taking signups, the mod can post that it's closed.  I'll be making a separate post shortly with signups for the next game since there seems to be some interest.</p></div></article><article id="post-4027" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Claudaro</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 1:17:56 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Newbie Mafia: Round Two</p>

<p>This will be another newbie game that will be fairly simple to allow for learning.  The exact setup will be determined based on how many players sign up for it.  It will have some kind of flavor, but I will likely avoid using GS as a source this time, to try and make it easier to focus on the game, and not the window dressing, like what happened last time.  If you are interested, find the most recent post, and add yourself to the list, if it's full, add another line!  Make sure to use double spaces at the end of your name, that seems to matter in this forum's layout sometimes.  I also strongly recommend using reply at the bottom, rather than the quick post reply, as it gives you a preview.</p>

<p>I don't think I did this correctly, format wise. Given that I created an account just to play your game, Claudaro, allowances should be made.

This is a variation of mafia, in that there is still a "town" and "anti-town" faction, lynches occur, but it is a night-less game.  It is well balanced for six players, which we appear to have.</p>

<p>The setup is as follows.  one person is the king, one person is an assassin trying to kill the king.  The other four players are guards.  The guards know who the king is, but not who each other are.  The king and the assassin don't know who anyone is.  Each day, someone is lynched.  If a guard is lynched, then the next day starts immediately, and repeats.  If (Somehow, I wouldn't mention it unless I saw it happen due to someone being very dumb IMO) the king is lynched, then the assassin wins.  If the assassin is lynched, then they get to immediately decide who to kill.  If they kill the king, the assassin wins, if they kill a guard, the guards and the king all win.</p>

<p>If this is something you are still interested in, please post back here confirming as much.  If all six are in still, I'll go ahead and run that game, else, I'll be putting a pin in this due to lack of interest.</p>
