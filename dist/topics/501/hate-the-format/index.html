<p>I suppose I could spend the time looking into that.  That being said I've been a regular participant on dozens of forum sites over the years from sports to hobbies to politics and I can honestly say that I've never changed settings on any of them.  It's a format that I'm not used to and I imagine a lot of people would feel the same way.  That could be a problem when you're trying to attract an audience.  I'll keep checking and reading.  I just don't find it conducive to exchanging information in a an effective and easy to read manner.  </p>

<p>The folder is suggestions and concerns.  It's a concern.  If I'm the only person who feels that way then by all means delete the thread.  I'm an old libertarian male. I'd say conservative but many today tend to associate that with the republican party which is far from the truth. =P</p>

<p>As an example, I'm typing now into a box on half the screen, while the other half has a similar box that's mirroring this one.

<p>What you're seeing and hating is the responsive aspect of the design. Any webpage designed since 2013 has it. Sad fact is, based on the demographics I've seen over the past four years, most websites are browsed equally (about 33% each) between tablet, mobile, and desktop. That means that 66% of the time, your screen isn't the one being looked at, but the smaller version for a tablet or phone (shrink your browser window and you'll see what that does is remove all the whitespace, then start shrinking other stuff to fit it on whatever screen is displaying it).  To give you an idea, here's a single day view of one of my client website's google analytics breakdowns:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UWuzk8J.jpg" alt="alt text" title="" /></p>

<p>And that's on a site that you'd think would be easiest to browse on an actual computer. It's a business to business portal for a Muffinarium. </p>

<p>Long story short, desktops aren't the device that's designed for first anymore, and the whitespace on the outside is just the direction of modern web design for the past few years. It could be replaced with a color or graphic with just a bar down the middle like some websites, but then it's harder to make it look as clean on all the mobile devices and tablets.</p></div></article><article id="post-5305" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 11:07:33 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@flimbo I agree/disagree with this. While "mobile first" is definitely the go-to model for web design these days, it is still possible to create a separate look on desktop that maintains those BIP standards.

<p>I'm not a huge fan of the look of the forums, but since it's still in its infancy and looks to be run by more back-end devs than designers, I can't really complain about it. Growing pains, man!</p>

<p>I dunno. I kinda agree/disagree as well in that yeah that's kinda what I meant in my last sentence about making the simple change to look nicer on desktop makes it harder for mobile/tablet design, but at the same time I think there's a disconnect between change in monitor resolution over the years that some of the older folks are seeing and disliking as well. </p>

<p>The official forums and the PC scale to 100% width, which was fine when everyone was running 1024x768 because it's relatively thin horizontally. Much like the thin column on newer desktop responsive designs that is there but semi-hidden in whitespace: All the text/graphics conform to that thinner inner boundary than your newer widescreen monitor can display. And to an extent, that's on purpose, because reading this wall of text explanation of all that on a 4k display that scales 100% results in one, maybe two exceptional long lines and you've actually got to turn your head to read the whole thing.  Keeping all the meat of the page bound in that inner portion is not only good for mobile/tablet design, but also for ease of readability over the old 100% width formats. I haven't checked this site, but I think most inner boundaries for desktops are still set at 980px width, just as they were in 1024x768, and while that was done largely for a while because people still used it (and still do but that number is getting small enough not to worry about), now it's done because it's just easier to read on the gigantic monitors we all have because third world slave labor yaaaay.</p></div></article><article id="post-5307" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 11:34:19 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@flimbo said in <a href="/post/5306">Hate the Format</a>:</p>

<p>I definitely don't disagree with you there. There's an entire science behind web content, and it changes almost on the daily. I'd halfheartedly argue that the current width of the text on these forums is -too wide-, especially on my 33" monitor but for someone running something much smaller it might be fine. Don't even get me started about designing for 4k. For someone who loves the "zig zag" feel of full-width images and container-constrained content, having to deal with the ramifications of someone viewing my website on their 72" 4k tv requires more caffeination than I've got in me right now.</p>

<p>It's part of my ongoing love/hate relationship with frameworks like bootstrap. They have a great mobile-first design structure that almost always forces me to rework columns and rows for optimal desktop design. Even with the addition of flexbox structure to BS4 alpha, it's still a little clunky on desktop.</p>

<p>Given how far we've come in regards to responsive design, I think it's a great dilemma to find ourselves in.</p></div></article><article id="post-5309" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ponclast</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 2:14:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir said in <a href="/post/5295">Hate the Format</a>:</p>

<p>Wow, thoughtful and productive response here Whirlin.  If I didn't already think you were a decent dude I'd have pegged you for a condescending asshole based on this post alone.</p>

<p>The settings don't allow me to make this site look like what I'm used to and prefer.  That is, what 99% of message boards look like today.   I now understand that vbulletin-style and similar sites may become a thing of the past as more and more people are browsing on their phones and tablets, but for the moment this is a message board that doesn't look like a message board in my opinion, at least when viewed on a PC.  I've since communicated with others who feel the same. Obviously, my opinion may absolutely suck and be a part of the clear minority, but it's my opinion. </p>

<p><strong>Flimbo</strong>.....thanks for your extremely insightful response.  Your post makes sense and answered my concerns, and I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Guess I'll walk away from this thread now.  Maybe if I went with "dislike" instead of "hate" in the subject title I could have gotten off a little easier with Whirlin.  I apologize.</p>

<p>Regardless of how the site looks to me I'll likely check on these boards with as much regularity as the PC forum, and who knows, maybe I'll grow to like this format in time!
I don't often view message board sites on my phone.  If I start to do that more frequently maybe I'll change for the better!  For now I remain a vbulletin-style guy and I'm not afraid to admit it! =P</p>

<p>probably because he complained before even going into the settings to see what was available. Also his "I'm a Libertarian, so I'm allowed to do that" excuse.</p>

We've just had a couple other technical hurdles to tackle.  The mobile integration is great, better than PC hands down, but haven't messed with the Tapatalk integration Kranar re-enabled.  More options will become visible to you as you use it more.  For example, there was a concern with the preview pane (which is hide-able)</p>

<p>Why I'm coming down hard:</p>

<p>I don't like soft requirements: They give shit guidance on development efforts, and usually people have something in mind, but without them clearly stating what they're looking for, they're gonna get bright pink backgrounds because all they wanted was not white/black, and that's another color.  Devs aren't happy, people aren't happy, it's time invested, it's lose-lose.</p>

<p>If someone states "There's too much white space on the left/right margins of the screen, it looks like the center 70% of being used in the bottom frame".  This is actionable, specific, the current definition and requested state are clearly defined.  </p>

<p>"There's too much white space" doesn't direct any efforts in any capacity.  Is that the top frame?  Right frame?  Between posts, between characters?  Is it the top header before the navigation buttons?  Should there be something to the right of the user identifier circle in the top right? </p>

<p>The more specificity, the easier our work becomes, the better the end product.</p></div></article><article id="post-5347" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 22nd, 2017, 2:20:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>One thing I do think would be great to add is a prompt for cancelling posts.

<p>The purpose of feedback is improvement of whatever the feedback is being provided on.  You (if you have any role in the success or failure of this forum) should be happy to be getting feedback and should take it to heart, instead of attacking those who provide it.  It's not the role of everyone who uses this forum to ask themselves, "gee, I wonder if this has been mentioned.  I better do a search before I comment."  If you want to shut down feedback channels, just keep attacking the messengers.  That should do it.</p>

<p>When did I say they weren't trying to improve?  If I thought they weren't trying to improve I wouldn't be offering feedback.  None of the specific items I referenced have been implemented on this forum, where the format basically boils down to "posts divided by a single line."  If that's what people agree they want, I can manage, but I prefer more graphics, and voiced that opinion here, where it's the topic.  Whirlin, who I gather is involved in the format here, asked for specifics in the area of feedback.  I provided them.
