<p>You see Chatelaine Rohese Bayvel-Timsh'l Illistim the Patron of the Displaced.</p>

<p>She appears to be an Elf.</p>

<p>She is taller than average with a slender willowy form. She appears to be youthful. She has silver-lashed misty grey eyes and silky smooth, fair skin. She has lustrous, hip-length pale silver hair tucked into a loose chignon adorned with a fluted citrus yellow calla lily with saffron and gold striations. She has naturally glossy, rose-pink tinted lips. Peeking through her hair are dainty upswept ears tapering to fine points which enhance her fey-like countenance. She has muted golden pink gloss brushed onto her slim fingernails.</p>

<p>She has a cascade of tiny silver stars tattooed over her right eyebrow that fades into her hairline, and an inking of a faint star constellation on her neck.</p>

<p>She is in good shape.</p>

<p>She is wearing a pair of dark gold drop earrings, a loosely draped dark gold chiffon stole, a pair of elbow-length salmon pink suede gloves, a platinum wedding ring, a structured off-shoulder gown of palest pink faille split over glossy saffron taffeta, and some vibrant saffron sandals perched on narrow gold spikes.</p>

<p>Rohese has sweet tendrils of chamomile encircling her, the warm, honeyed fragrance tamed by tart notes of lemongrass and the faintest caress of lush briar roses. Beneath it all, base notes of dark vanilla unite the fragrance as a whole.</p></div></article><article id="post-1448" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 11:24:51 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You see Maylan the Master Healer.</p>

<p>She appears to be an Aelotoi of the Mrae'ni Clan.</p>

<p>She is of a slight height and has a thin, wiry frame.  She appears to be in the spring of life.  She has completely solid, vivid jade eyes and mocha-freckled, lightly tanned skin.  She has unevenly cut, tangled raven-sheened hair that haphazardly falls about her face and is barely contained by a stiff leather tricorne.  She has a narrow face, a gently sloped nose and a pointed chin.  She has a small gap between her front teeth.  She has a discolored mop-fringed pegleg for a leg.  She has a pair of curvy, dark-veined pearly wings rippled with peacock patterns.</p>

<p>She has a tiny flawless diamond stud in her right nostril, and a drunk puppy tattoo with a lolling tongue on her leg.</p>

<p>She is in good shape.</p>

<p>She is wearing a pair of peacock feather earrings, a slender leather choker clasped by a jade teardrop, a dingy tin wedding band, a pieced leather pack, a glossy cordovan leather bandolier over a scarlet silk saephua splattered in crusted green muck stains, a spiraled ouroburos rainbow glaes armband, a rune-carved drinking horn suspended from a thin strap, a soft suede herb kit stamped with a blooming sovyn, and some ebon silk pantaloons speckled with fuzzy red mold.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>look pegleg
  Cracked and discolored, the faded blonde wooden pegleg bears a suspicious resemblance to the hacked-off business end of a ratty old mop.  A thick, tangled fringe of sodden, grey-brown cotton splays out from its splintered tip like a dejected anemone and leaves a smear of filth wherever it goes.</p>

He appears to be a Faendryl Dark Elf.
He is average height.  He appears to be ancient.  He has thick-lashed stormy grey eyes and black skin.  He has shoulder length, flowing mithril-hued hair finger-combed into a naturally tousled style.  He has a small deep green spider on his neck.
He has a crescent moon tattoo on his neck.</p>

<p>You are wearing an an elven-wrought eonake circlet skeletally caged with illthorn branches, a brushed obsidian wool cloak caught at the shoulder with a triskele of scarlet despanal, a storm grey Faendryl-style tabard over some Ithziri eahnor chain armor with a black leather arming doublet underneath, a bone and illthorn phylactery, a small eonake star,  a miniature crossed silver swords pin,  a weathered leather herb sack with a thick shoulder strap slung over your shoulder,  an embroidered grey spidersilk satchel slung over your other shoulder, a seasoned dusky leather pack,  a veil iron mesh surcoat, a lor triskele inset with three ebon-veined scarlet despanals, some archaic elven-crafted vambraces forged in a faenor-gilt lor leaf pattern, some dusky leather gloves knuckled in wrought iron leaves, an ancient Faendryl band, a bronze Faendryl signet ring, a thick leather sword belt with overlapping dull iron leaves, a vine-engraved verdant faenor scabbard, a veniom-worked black silk gem pouch, an ancient faenor key hung from a silver chain, some pleated black linen trousers with green and grey striations, some archaic elven-crafted greaves forged in a faenor-gilt lor bark pattern, and some scuffed hunter green knee-high boots.</p>

<p>A few items that display our GM's efforts.</p>

<p>look armor
The timeworn suit of armor is comprised of a multitude of delicate six in one interwoven links, subtly tinted in autumnal hues ranging from faded eahnor red, through burnt umber and traced with limned moss green. The impossibly intricate woven assemblage creates a lor leaf patterned shifting mosaic that wisp's silver vapor with each movement and the entire suit is layered over faded green leather.  You see nothing unusual, except for a small enchanter's glyph.  A strange necrotic haze radiates from the armor.</p>

<p>Look tabard
The faendryl-style scout's tabard has a stiff, short collar designed to curve comfortably around the wearer's neck.  Veniom thread, embroidered on the back panels, depicts the crest of House Moonshadew.  Embroidered on a front panel is a small gold and crimson phoenix.</p>

<p>l band
The band's engraving indicates it was cast for veterans of the Third Elven War.  Running along the inside of the band, a name is engraved in precise, angular script.  There appears to be something written on it.</p>

<p>l star
Engraved on the star are the words "To Honor and to Serve"</p>

<p>l surcoat
Rare veil iron has been painstakingly crafted into an intricate mesh, retaining the strength of the metal while allowing for a flexible garment.  Despite the metal, the surcoat retains the appearance of elegant outerwear, boasting intricately crafted folds designed to cover any armor.  A sleek cowl completes the garment, with subtle color variations linked into the mesh to give a hint of flair to the piece.</p>

<p>l pack
This pack is made of sturdy leather but has seen much use.  Several claw marks can be seen on the back of the pack, but have been roughly repaired with various pieces of thin twine.  A single clasp, made from a small rolaren leaf secures this sturdy pack shut.  Along the side of the dusky leather pack are a series of narrow scabbards, several which are rhimar-throated, as well as a small number of loops.</p>

<p>l band
Etched on the wide bronze band, within the oval face of the signet, is an ancient fallen grey tower, some of the structure crumbled beyond repair.  Twin budding lor trees flank the rubble, the limbs sprayed outward through the ruins, the appendages etched with the words, "Moon Whisper" as they arc upwards towards the top most edges of the ring face.  The silver-toned tree limbs flank the remaining structure of the tower, reinforcing the sides and doorway with thickly braided designs.
There appears to be something written on it.</p></div></article><article id="post-1494" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kaikala</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 5:51:44 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@maylan That peg leg cracks me up so bad! ;)</p></div></article><article id="post-1495" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 6:01:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@kaikala said in <a href="/post/1494">What are you wearing?</a>:</p>

She has a heart-shaped face and a pair of half-lensed spectacles perched upon her small nose.  Her small, yet distinctively sloping nose is perfectly offset by the bowed curve of her upper lip, while her slender neck and delicate bone structure enhance her fragile appearance.

<p>She is holding a lacquered case sculpted from layers of parchment in her left hand.</p>

<p>She is wearing a pebble-fixed tatted lace choker, a platinum wedding ring, a shredded cornsilk chiffon gown bound by a longline corset of torn leather bookspines, and a pair of dark distressed leather high shoes trimmed with pale lace.</p>

<p>Choker ~ Oyster silk ribbons unite the ends of a length of pale grey needle-tatted lace to form a charming and understated choker. Tumbled until flat and smooth, an oval pebble of pallid rainbow sandstone is fixed to the center of the piece, perfectly sized so as to rest comfortably in the hollow of the wearer's throat.</p>

<p>Rohese has a wild melange of floral scents floating about her. The untameable scent of heather is accented by larkspur and breaths of fairy primrose.</p></div></article><article id="post-1666" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Hips</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 10:00:05 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Another Ta'Illistim event, another outfit.</p>

She has rich, copper-infused henna red hair styled into a complex arrangement of looping and draping plaits, woven through with some vivid scarlet flowering maple curving into bell-shaped blossoms. She has a serene and delicate face and slightly upswept ears arcing to fine points. The planes of her cheeks and the swell of her lips echo the curvilinear forms of gently unfurling new leaves.

<p>Shoes ~ Buttery soft suede, silvery grey in hue, has been stretched tightly across the high vamp of these backless shoes to ensure a tight but comfortable fit. The subtle blend of colors displayed by the napped finish gives the leather an almost metallic quality which is accentuated by the tiny steel rivets along the welt. Precariously balanced on a contoured rowan wood platform beneath just the ball of the foot, the sole arcs gracefully upward and leaves the heel completely exposed and unsupported.</p>

<p>Rohese has a well-meshed collection of woodland scents haunting the air about her -- detectable are fresh pine sap, oak, dew-damp moss, and patchouli.</p></div></article><article id="post-1957" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rohese</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 7:26:11 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Back to the "Shabby Chic" and probably my favourite so far.</p>

Lining the base of the interior are layers of thick white cotton, stopping just short of a latch securing the opening of a separate compartment large enough to hold a few cubes of ice. A circular plate etched with an oak leaf is affixed to one flat side alongside the fettered end of a dark leather belt loop.</p>

<p>Bodice ~ Narrow stays support panels of matte gold leather to ensure a tapering silhouette when the lacing is pulled taut through a spinal column of copper grommets. Radiating upwards and outwards from the basque waist, a blend of tawny and claret foil leaves cover the entire bodice in a blaze of autumnal color, their veins accented by gilt threadwork. Similar stitching frames the exposed decolletage, rising to a flared collar of grouse feathers, cradling the back of the head in rust red plumage.</p>

<p>Rohese has a near smothering veil of hardwood smoke about her, darkened by black musk and redeemed only slightly by a lucent ember of heliotrope burning in the background. From beneath the soot of the head notes rise strains of cassis and bitter-green inclusions of wormwood.</p></div></article><article id="post-2120" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Hips</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 17th, 2017, 6:16:09 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Gearing up for endless arena runs since DR beta testing starts tonight in Plat.</p>

<p>You see your ring. Tiny scales of polished silver and dull alum have been layered in a seemingly random pattern to form a full finger-length ring.

<blockquote>
  <p>l choker (FWI transporter)
  You see your choker. Caught in a tangle of satin-sheen gold filaments are small, yellow jade cinquefoils. The five heart-shaped petals of each blossom surround a cluster of coppery stamens, drawing the eye into their very depths where tiny crystals seem to glisten like droplets of dew. Scattered throughout the floriated choker are a blend of varied green, orange, and red jade-carved leaves, adding hints of autumnal color to the piece.</p>

  Square in shape, this highly decorative case boasts a front panel of cedar marquetry lacquered for a mirror finish and accented with polished gold hinges and hasp. Intermittent tans of blonde tortoiseshell within the geometric design complement the lighter streaks inherent in the reddish-brown softwood, whilst a rigid framework of kakore slats line the interior to provide convenient compartments for all manner of small and large items.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>l earrings (FW transporter)
  You see your earrings. A length of thin gilded wire connects each small stud to a drop pendant earring. Whilst the head of the fish is static, with the bale attached to the tip of its nose, six segments of solid silver make up its slender body and are articulated to allow for subtle movement. Glossy celadon-hued enamel adds texture and interest to an already singular piece of craftsmanship, with accents of vibrant turquoise and pearlised creamy white inlay on the underside of the caudal fin.</p>
  
  <p>l locket (normally hidden)
  Strung from a simple silver chain, the locket is fashioned of a rough piece of driftwood that has been fused to an ovoid of flatted silver. Clear lacquer allows the driftwood to be preserved and prevents any splintering or fracturing, while the image of a single trident has been burned into the wood. A small oval hasp on the door of the piece allows it to be secured in place as the need arises. (bonded and with a portrait of the hubs inside)</p>

She has naturally glossy, rose-pink tinted lips.  Peeking through her hair are dainty upswept ears tapering to fine points which enhance her fey-like countenance.  She has gleaming dark indigo polish brushed onto her neatly squared fingernails.
She has a cascade of tiny silver stars tattooed over her right eyebrow that fades into her hairline, and an inking of a faint star constellation on her neck.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a lengthy platinum lariat necklace split by a claw of faceted iolite, some sweeping black satin robes with floor-length sleeves split at the shoulders, a platinum wedding ring, an off-shoulder indigo silk gown with fingertip-length sleeves, and some black leather chopines atop concave ebony platforms.</p>

<p>Rohese has in the air about her a shroud, as light as feathered wings, held aloft by a breath of wisteria incense stirred by strands of niveous calla lily.  Chords of white sandalwood and rose attar thread languidly throughout, underscored by a touch of frankincense.</p></div></article><article id="post-7562" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Satia</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 19th, 2017, 9:17:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You see Lady Alasatia Sol'naire the Elemental Herald.
She appears to be a Faendryl Dark Elf.
She is of a slight height and has a slender build. She appears to be in the spring of life. She has fervent silver-pupiled smokey feystone eyes and silken nutmeg skin. She has heavily textured, gradient red hair pulled over one shoulder and twisted beneath a curved lor fascinator traced in tendrils of glaes smoke. She has a delicately boned face, a subtly upturned-tipped nose and small, slim pointed ears. A constellation of beauty marks is scattered across her neck and collarbone.
She has an archaic black rune that coils down the left side of her face, a sapphire-scaled ouroboros tattoo encircling a dancing flame on her wrist, a greyscale Faendryl portrait on her arm, an inked spiral of deconstructed feathers on her wrist, an inked mural of honeycombed earthen fissures on her leg, and an inked trio of twining waterspouts in saturated blue tones on her leg.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing several necklaces of linked labradorite crescents, a jewel-sheened layered silk pelerine, a dichroic glass agave rosette, a side-ruched black silk tunic, a petrified lor relic, a dainty chatelaine coin purse, a sideless floor-length skirt of twisted ianthine silk, and a pair of dichroic glass slippers inset with shadow amethysts.</p>

<p>You have a heady redolence clinging to your skin, with top notes of chocolate as dark as moonless night. From beneath, infusions of black-red plum drift to the surface, accompanied by poignant touches of amaretto that blend seamlessly into a silage of dark vanilla.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
