There were some discrepencies especially with the games and DSD but I think much of that was 'above your paygrade'.</p>

<p>You're also incredibly responsive to player requests and queries. Very fair as well. If ever Wyrom were to step down in the future, you should seriously consider taking his spot. I think a more feminine touch can go a long way in this type of game. </p>

<p>Thanks and expecting many more,</p>
