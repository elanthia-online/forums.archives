<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>I added in a command, REIM CLEAR, to allow for you to prematurely stop your current quest. This will end your timer and allow you to re-enter under a different cooldown if it is available.</p>

<p>IE: Starting your quest with a paid entry before your premium entry and wanting to use your premium entry sooner.</p>

<p>Please note that this is permanent, it has a confirmation, and there are no refunds for accidental use of this. Use of this command outside of its intended use can lead to punishment.</p>

<p>Retser, ASGM</p></div></article><article id="post-7648" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">JNewhall</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 27th, 2017, 5:45:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What is its intended use?
