<p>I don't know who you expect to accept this deal.</p>

<p>You're asking someone to sell you $4000 worth of something, and offering them $3000 for it.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to give away $1000, I'll make this same offer as @Sacru.</p>

<p>Those silvers would have to sell for $8/million to break even, and they're nowhere close to that.</p></div></article><article id="post-2289" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 7:44:55 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir I can appreciate the way that you price your items, and what you put out there in terms of what you yourself are willing to pay for things that you want. I get what you're doing, and is beneficial to the perceived value of silver. There is no doubt of that. </p>

<p>If nobody goes for my offer, its not going to stop me from buying the books. I'll just be paying slightly more for them. Simu will get the same amount either way, so what do they care?</p>

<p>If someone does go for my offer, then I have provided a valuable service, clearly, or the hypothetical transaction would not have happened in the first place.</p>

<p>At first I thought you might have typo'd the offer.  Then I realized that no, you're actually offering $1000 less than what something is worth (right now).</p>

<p>The fact that you're going to buy either way is irrelevant to the offer you made.</p>

<p>I was just looking for confirmation that you're aware of what you're offering, and apparently you're more than aware that you're basically asking someone to give you $1000 worth of something for free.</p></div></article><article id="post-2299" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 8:14:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir said in <a href="/post/2298">Wholesale 50ct Booklets</a>:</p>
