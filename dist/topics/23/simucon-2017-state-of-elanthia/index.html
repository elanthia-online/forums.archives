<p>.</p>

<p><strong>REIM 2.0</strong>:  Reim Defense (Not to be confused with Reim 1.0)
- Adding a free premium 1x day entry.
- You may have to choose which instance to go into 1x/day - they haven't decided if it's 1 free entry into each. (We should probably ask for it to be 1x to each.)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Weighting &amp; Padding</strong>: <br />
- Currently takes up a weighting/padding "spot"
- They are moving weighting/padding to it's own spot to open up more abilities. <br />
- "Flaring claidhmores" - "Blessable + Weighting"</p>

<p>They will be offering more weighting/padding services so it's not always locked behind a pay wall. (Aug-Sept time frame)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Duskruin:</strong> <br />
- There will be <strong>NEW</strong> 3v3 matches (3 players versus 3 creatures) - Individual Rewards
- New high end item for sale:  <a href="https://gswiki.play.net/Great_Auction_of_2016/teasers#The_Corasine_Relic">The coraesine relic</a>
- "Probably" cheaper weighting/padding certificates because it will be based upon your item.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Ebon Gate:</strong>
- Moving to a new area.
- We created a lich through the necropolis.
- New story
- New area -- Caligos Isle
- Will travel via boat(quest transport)
- Everyone will be able to go and enjoy it, but there will be different ticket options.
- New "Stuff" -- Deep sea diving - New type of game
- Digging!  (On a beach)
- No unlimited digging - You'll need to buy entries similiar to duskruin entries.
- GM Haliste will talk about it more
- Dates for EG? -- "All of October" w/ a Merchant Week.
- Quest to get to the island, everyone can participate.
- "Shop Pass" - to enter a shop (Probably around $10)
- Games will have an additional cost.
- "Seashells" as tickets - Will be able to buy things for silver
- New lesser spirit Arkati
- New quest item you can build up over years
- Carousel plans are in discussion (Key to the Midway is not at the new venue)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Will creatures be updated to account for the weighting/padding availability increase?</strong>
- No</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Silver drains:</strong>
- No clear indication it's being addressed</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>New Capped Area:</strong>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Player Suggestion - Expansions for the clothing system?</strong>
- No
- Wyrom has an idea for a way to hide items without needing a concealer.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Doughtman's Challenge:</strong>
- Thinking of a way to resurrect it.
- Creating items for it is painful because 1000+ items mostly fell on one person to create.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Player Suggestion - Account bound benefits:</strong>
- Win a quest - Your character earns "5 points of weighting"</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Private property:</strong>
- List of upgrades is being worked on, trying to find options that work for the SimuCoin shop.</p></div></article><article id="post-68" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 5th, 2017, 6:11:12 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Thanks for putting this together.</p></div></article><article id="post-72" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Goat</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 5th, 2017, 11:24:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Thanks for the write-up.</p></div></article><article id="post-5101" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 14th, 2017, 11:32:38 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Just picked the first simucon topic to put this.

  <p>Hey guys,</p>
  
  <p>Sorry for the lack of response so far. We had a major snafu with the scripted item we had planned, and I'm working on getting a replacement. Hopefully I can get this >turned around in the next week. I'm really very sorry about the delay. :(</p>
