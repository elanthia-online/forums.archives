Gems [3]: a trio of aquamarine cabochons, several tiny cream-hued pearls, several teardrop emeralds
Clothing [2]: a series of thick silver bracelets, a water sapphire-inlaid key</p>

<p>A silver-lined Tridacna box - You get the sense that a silver-lined tridacna box must always have a noun of box.  It may never be fashioned into a worn item.  It has the following verbs: open and close, but it also has a loresong.</p>

<p>Tugging the hasp from the heart-shaped lock on the rolled lip of the tridacna box, you gently lift the upper piece of the bivalve mollusk to reveal the rich, cobalt blue velvet that lines the bottom half.</p>

<p>You get a sense that the a water sapphire-inlaid key must always have a noun of key, but that the material it is strung from can be changed to anything appropriate for a necklace.  It uses the verbs wear, remove, push, pull, and turn.  If it is pushed, it will be tucked into your shirt.  If it is pulled, it will be removed.</p>

<p>You analyze your thick silver bracelets and sense that the item is largely free from merchant alteration restrictions, but the creator has stated that "The item has restrictions on changing the noun."</p>

<p>The creator has also provided the following information:</p>

<p>The bracelets has special messaging for WEAR, REMOVE, PUSH, and PULL.</p>

<p>The bracelets may be altered, however it must meet the following restrictions:
Wrist worn items must keep the noun of bracelet(s), wristlet(s), or bangle(s).</p>

<p>The bracelets may only have a short base description change (see ALTER 2).  It cannot support a long or a show description.</p>

<p>The bracelets resonates with your voice, indicating that it enhances its owner in the following ways:
    It provides a bonus of 5 to Spiritual Lore - Religion Ranks.
    It provides a bonus of 5 to Armor Use Ranks.
    This enhancive item may not be used by the following professions: Warrior Rogue Wizard Cleric Empath Sorcerer Ranger Bard Monk Paladin
    The bracelets looks to have a lot of charges remaining.</p>

<p>You are unable to determine if the thick silver bracelets will persist after its last enhancive charge has been expended.</p>

<p>Nice enhancive for my paladin actually.</p></div></article><article id="post-6117" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Erous</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, October 7th, 2017, 3:22:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@mogonis said in <a href="/post/6112">Post Your EG 2017 T5/Jackpot Wins</a>:</p>

<p>Fashioned of rigid leather and reinforced with indigo faenor plates and bands, this well-used armor bears a small crest of Ta'Ashrim across the chest.  Upon closer inspection, it is apparent that the metal parts of the armor have all been scuffed and dyed to a matte finish, while the leather is a rich dark brown.  You see nothing unusual, except for a small enchanter's glyph.  The hardened armor is adorned with an elegant set of burnished leather pauldrons.  The left pauldron has a crest on it, but it is difficult to discern its details from this angle.  The right pauldron is expertly tooled with a stylized image of a fierce eel ready to strike.</p>

<p>You analyze your faenor-banded scalemail and sense that the item is largely free from merchant alteration restrictions.
The creator has also provided the following information:</p>

<p>You sense that the scalemail can be altered, but bear in mind that no matter what the merchant does, the pauldrons and hardened look of the armor cannot be removed.</p>

<p>This armor has a customized creature on the right pauldron.  Some merchants may be able to change the images on your pauldrons, though the options are quite limited.</p>

<p>You can try to RUB, POKE, SLAP, KNOCK, and WEAR the scalemail.</p>

<p>You can tell that the scalemail is as light as it can get.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rub scale
  You brush the accumulated dust and grime off the pauldrons of your hardened armor, the eel gleaming regally on the right pauldron.</p>
  
  <p>poke scale
  You rap a finger hard against the hardened armor breastplate!</p>
  
  <p>slap scale
  You slap lightly at the right pauldron of your hardened armor.</p>
  
  <p>knock scale
  You thump the hardened breastplate of your armor, glaring around at your surroundings.
  Your careful inspection of some rigid faenor-banded scalemail allows you to conclude that it is rigid leather armor that covers the torso, arms, legs, neck, and head.</p>

Kind of a waste to have +10 Thrown bonus on the javelin. No one would risk losing it.</p>

<p>a long ironwood case
Hinged with bronze, the ironwood case bears the telltale signs of water damage and exposure to cold weather.  Splinters stand out from the lid, and one of the four corners is missing its metal footing.  The seal of some barony, burned into the side at some point in the piece's past, is illegible due to the ragged scratches that crisscross it.</p>

<p><code>Molded leather covers the demonic face of the warmask, which is comprised of an elongated snout that is drawn back in a sneer and fitted with yellow ivory tusks.  Twisted horns rise out of the top, their curved ends ending in points that are capped with steel.  An oiled finish gives the piece a weather friendly finish and enhances the incarnadine hue, while a short missive is stamped into the edge.</code></p>

<p><code>There appears to be something written on it.</code>
<code>In the Common language, it reads:</code>
<code>To have died on the wall is to have lived on the wall.  ~ Demonwall, 5098</code></p>

<p>JAVELIN - 4lbs, 4x, ice flares, +10 Thrown Bonus - Only usable by warriors, rogues, rangers, and paladins</p>

<p><code>Painted incarnadine, the modwir haft of the javelin has a tracery of ebon whorls decorating its smooth surface.

Vultite rivets hold the matching spear head in place at one end, while the other is capped with black lacquer.</code>

Armor [1]: a sea serpent adamantine greatshield
Gems [1]: an uncut diamond
Special [1]: some silver coins
Total items: 3
Large and rectangular, the greatshield is comprised of a single, thick sheet of adamantine that is wrought in the image of a snarling sea serpent.  Webbed ears flank its face, while teardrop scales cover most of the breath and girth of its body.  Enormous emeralds rest within the eyes, which are covered by long, shaggy brows.  The sinuous body is coiled as if rising out of the cresting waves that decorate the bottom of the piece.  On the reverse of the greatshield, a complex webbing of oiled leather straps and polished buckles forms an intricate arm harness.  The straps are arranged in a pattern that appears able to secure a weapon within.
You unbuckle the oiled leather harness of your greatshield.  Carefully, you slide your no-dachi into the webbing, then cinch it tightly.
You analyze your adamantine greatshield and sense that the item is largely free from merchant alteration restrictions.</p>

<p>The creator has also provided the following information:
You get a strong sense that the greatshield can be altered by any merchant as long as the harness" remains in place.</p>

<p>Currently you are able to use DROP, RUB (Get Weapon), TURN, COWER, and PUNCH/KILL/SLAP/BATTER on the adamantine greatshield.  The size of the weapon that can be stored in the greatshield's harness is dependent on the size of the shield.</p>

<p>You might be able to have a talented merchant lighten the adamantine greatshield for you.</p></div></article><article id="post-6313" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kaight</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 11th, 2017, 10:29:00 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>T5

Twin octopuses, wrought of bronze that has an artful verdigris finish, perch upon the rectangular handles, their tentacles inventively wrapping about the long handles and disappearing into the wood.</p>
  
  <p>examine plate Fashioned with an artfully rolled lip, the broad expanse of the rectangular plate is mostly white with a sateen finish. Indigo blue pigments painted from the top right of the plate create the image of an octopus with twisting tentacles that stretch away from the bulbous head towards the left edge. Delicate brush strokes form the suction cups that decorate the spindled limbs, while prominent ones outline with great detail the cephalopod's eye.</p>
  
  <p>examine tea Uniformly white, the lip of the teacup is smooth and gently rolled to create an even finish. Painted upon one side, an indigo blue octopus stretches its tentacles outward, which the crafter has brilliantly turned into a handle that is complete with three dimensional suction cups.</p>
  
  <p>examine sauc Cobalt blue scallop shells ring the edge of the white, round saucer, the paint startlingly bright against the stark white porcelain. Tiny waves ripple from the edges towards the center, the delicate brushstrokes that are their design frothing at the center where they are drawn in collision with one another.</p>
  
  <p>examine spoon Fashioned of pewter, the spoon is wrought in the image of an octopus perched upon a piece of driftwood. Its long tentacles are wrapped completely around the wood, though the ends manage to clutch onto a shell, which is actually the bowl of the spoon.</p>

  You unlatch the toggle on your silver and teak case and hear a strange whirring sound, causing you to remove your hand from the toggle.

The doors at the hinges bend and slide into a small compartment at the bottom, turning the case into a sand and blue lacquered platter.

  Coarse sand spreads across the interior of the blue lacquered platter to create a beach scene along one side, which slowly transitions to a lacquered blue finish that resembles waves.

  <p>look plate
  Cobalt blue paints stand out brightly upon the smooth face of the porcelain plate, the delicate brushstrokes creating the image of a three-masted frigate in the center.  Wavy lines of the same hue provide a subtle border along the lip, while around the vessel's masts puffy clouds pass by and are limned with silver.
  look teac
  Cobalt blue paints decorate the bottom of the delicate teacup and depict calm waters under a cloudless sky.  Seagulls dip and whirl in the air, while swordfish arc out of the water in wide dives.  A filigreed handle, also of porcelain, curves from the side and has a tiny flourish near the base.</p>

<p>an artistically dyed glowbark shield
Polished to a mirror finish, the dyed glowbark shield is artistically dyed with varying pigments to create the scene of a sprawling elven city perched within the cliffs of an island.  Undyed segments lend the walls, roofs, and patios of the metropolis a luminous quality that is only enhanced by the careful lines of verdant and ebon pigments that create wide open windows, curtained doorways, and verdant tropical foliage.  Deep blues and chocolate browns decorate the bottom where a harbor encircled by calm seas rests.  On the reverse of the shield, a complex webbing of oiled leather straps and polished buckles forms an intricate arm harness.  The straps are arranged in a pattern that appears able to secure a weapon within.</p>

<p>The creator has also provided the following information:
You get a strong sense that the shield can be altered by any merchant as long as the harness" remains in place.</p>

<p>Currently you are able to use DROP, RUB (Get Weapon), TURN, COWER, and PUNCH/KILL/SLAP/BATTER on the dyed glowbark shield.  The size of the weapon that can be stored in the shield's harness is dependent on the size of the shield.</p>

<p>You might be able to have a talented merchant lighten the dyed glowbark shield for you.</p>

Total items: 2
You analyze your ebony rolaren plate and sense that the item is largely free from merchant alteration restrictions.</p>

<p>The creator has also provided the following information:</p>

<p>The cut of this plate is designed to fit the female form only.  You sense you could WEAR, PULL, KNOCK, RUB and TAP the plate.  It is fully unlocked.</p>

<p>All normal alteration rules pertaining to armor apply.</p>

<p>You might be able to have a talented merchant lighten the ebony rolaren plate for you.</p>

<p>Left in its natural state, the rolaren of the plate is ebony teased with streaks of midnight blue that accentuate the smooth planes and curves of the armor. The pauldrons and upper guards of the vambraces are fluted for added strength, and the tassets are contoured to lie snug against the hips and thighs. Flourishes in simple intaglio reliefs adorn the breastplate and the outer curve of each pauldron and poleyn, providing a hint of couture to an otherwise utilitarian suit of armor.</p></div></article><article id="post-6629" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">helsfeld</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 16th, 2017, 1:17:55 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Alastir forgot about my amazing pull from the trunk was one of those sweet voodoo dolls truly the highlight of my whole week!</p></div></article><article id="post-6631" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kithus</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 16th, 2017, 6:15:27 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>T5: a collarless soft indigo suede tunic with eahnor wire-wrapped sleeves - 4x, crit padded, robes</p>

<p>Your careful inspection of a reticulated vultite wall shield studded with razor-sharp spikes allows you to conclude that it is a tower shield that protects the bearer if carried in the left hand.  You also notice that it is spiked.</p>

The creator has also provided the following information:
A pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls cannot be detailed to indicate that it is anything but long.  It cannot be altered to indicate that the lower portion of the garment (below the knees) is tight-fitting in any way; the upper portion can be, but not the lower.</p>

<p>The a pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls can be customized in the following manner, where any talented merchant can customize the bolded sections.  Note that customizations cannot use speech:
  (STAND) Standing primly you fluff the fabric of your gown out until it drapes down in a perfectly smooth and unblemished fashion.</p>

<p>(PUSH) You push your hands down against your gown in an elegant gesture.</p>

<p>(PULL) You pull the lower portion of a pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls up slightly, displaying your legs.  With a great deal of gumption, you move your feet in an intricate dance that leaves you breathless.  As you finish, your fingers release the gown's fabric.</p>

<p>(CURTSY) You dip your body, pulling the lower portion of a pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls out to either side of you so that the fabric drapes down like a gentle mist around your feet.  As you complete the formal curtsy you rise to your feet.</p>

<p>(SMELL) Holding a pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls up to your face, you inhale deeply, and the scent of *nightshade and roses fills your senses.</p>

<p>(KNEEL) You pull the hem of your gown up and back, then kneel in a reverent manner.</p>

<p>(WAVE)  You grasp the fabric of the skirted portion of a pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls and take a single step toward Durakar.  Smiling brilliantly you wave your free hand at [target].
  (WAVE - sitting) Smiling brilliantly at [target], you immediately rise to your feet, careful not to step on the hem of your gown in your quick movements.  You then grasp the fabric of the skirted portion of a pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls and wave your free hand at [target].
  (standing and sitting utilize the same customization wording)</p>

<p>(TAP - worn) You lightly flick your fingernails against the fabric of gown in a gesture that unequivocally expresses your disinterest.
  (TAP - not worn) You trace your fingers along a pale silver sea silk gown buttoned down the back with black pearls in a manner that indicates your current disinterest.
  (worn and not worn utilize the same customization wording)</p>

<p>(NUDGE) As you fiddle with your gown, an amused expression crosses your features.</p>

<p>Currently, you are able to use STAND, RUB, PUSH, TURN, SIT, PULL, CURTSY, SMELL, KNEEL, LIE, WEARMSG, REMOVEMSG, WAVE (with target), COVER, SCOWL, POUT, HUG, TAP, TILT, PLUCK, ROLL (with target), and NUDGE.</p>

a long ironwood case: 
Hinged with bronze, the ironwood case bears the telltale signs of water damage and exposure to cold weather.  Splinters stand out from the lid and one of the four corners is missing its metal footing.  The seal of some barony wood burned into the side at some point in the piece's past is illegible due to the ragged scratches that crisscross it.</p>

<p>In the ironwood case:
Weapons [1]: a sculpted white ora greataxe
Clothing [1]: a white-maned ironwood warmask</p>

<p>a white-maned ironwood warmask:
Polished smooth and preserved with a thin veneer of lacquer, the warmask is artfully carved into the semblance of a severe, bony-faced woman.  Aristocratic brows and nose stand out sharply upon the piece, while silver and white horse hairs create a wild mane that spills from the crown and is riddled with tiny bird bones and white dove feathers.  Thin lips are pursed in a frozen expression of disdain that is reflected in the cast of the onyx-lined eyes.
There appears to be something written on it.</p>

<p>In the Common language, it reads:
Ilburz lutkra ap burzmorad - Only when the last feather is plucked will the White Sparrows truly be dead.</p>

<p>The warmask resonates with your voice, indicating that it enhances its owner in the following ways:
    It provides a bonus of 5 to Swimming Bonus.
    It provides a bonus of 5 to Two-Handed Weapons Bonus.
    It provides a bonus of 5 to Survival Bonus.
    The warmask looks to have a lot of charges remaining.</p>

<p>a sculpted white ora greataxe:
Bright white furs encircle the entire length of the ironwood greataxe's haft and are bound in place by undyed rawhide strips.  Twin blades, wrought in the image of a bird's wings, rise from the central post in enormous crescents that are softly rounded at the top but sharply pointed at the bottom.  A central cap, wrought in the image of a woman's body that is dressed in embossed leathers, completes the piece and is studded with rolaren screws.  You see nothing unusual, except for a small enchanter's glyph.</p>

<p>4x, sancted, cold flares</p>

<p>Loresong:
Cold grips you as your song touches upon the greataxe, and the world around you dissolves into a barren landscape of snow and ice.  You find yourself walking and after a time realize that you are climbing towards a dark shadow in the white distance.  Slowly, the dark blur grows closer and reveals itself to be that of a small cottage, where a woman stands with her arm draped protectively over a thin child dressed in furs.  You drop to your knees before the scrawny child, who looks impossibly small and frail.</p>

<p>The woman cries out in denial, but quickly stuffs her fist into her mouth to muffle the sound.  Your gaze moves uncaring past the woman who now has tears trailing down her cheeks, and instead focuses upon the fire-haired child.  With great care, you place the greataxe into her incredibly small hands and once more, the older woman cries out in denial.  The roar follows you back to your body and sets your ears to ringing as the vision fades.
You lift your voice to the greataxe, and you find your vision return to the cold, bleak peak only to instantly be assaulted by the previous cries of denial.  Stoically, you ignore the source and begin to speak to the young girl in a voice worn with age.</p>

<p>"His final words for you, little one," you find yourself saying, "--were to find the Sparrows and join the flock."  This time, the savage cry of rage slams into you, and your vision swims.</p>

<p>Despite the assault, the greataxe fills your sight with image after image of the young girl growing older.  One scene repeats itself over and over, that of the child doing push-ups in her room with the axe strapped to her back.  The passage of time is noted by her hair growing longer, her body becoming lithe, and her muscles gaining bulk.  The vision begins to fade as the child-turned-woman stands, greataxe on her back, in a defiant pose before a heartbroken older woman.
A different song and scene greets you as you sing to the greataxe, and gone is the snow, ice, and silence of the mountains.  Instead, a bustling port sprawls before you, but even in the throng of people, you can easily make out the now tall, flame-haired girl.  She strides purposefully to a ship that has strangely dressed men and women moving about it, their faces painted white and their bodies draped in blue fur.  A look of recognition and yearning fills the young woman's eyes.</p>

<p>Scene after scene begins to rapidly play before you.  Each is filled with the flame-haired young woman diving into battle after battle upon the decks of a large ship.  The thrumming pulse of countless battles shows ferocity and determination -- her strengths and her finesse.  At times, she is the shield to the comrade that has fallen, while at others, she is the rage that charges headlong into the fray; always the greataxe in her hands.  Slowly, your vision fades in a sea of blue furs.
Coldness grips you, and your vision shifts to the deck of a ship littered with bodies and locked in ice.  The vessel is unmoving, and the mast is wreathed in long icicles that pierce the blood-blackened boards.  Easily identifiable amid the fur-wrapped bodies, the young woman can be seen crouching upon the deck, her red hair trailing behind her in a persistent wind that has turned her lips blue.  Slowly, she lowers her beloved greataxe into a case and, begins to pray.</p>

<p>"Charl, I beseech you," she prays in a surprisingly gentle voice.  "Break free your children, and return us to port.  In return, I will give you the very soul of my existence."</p>

<p>With a great cry, she uses the last of her strength to hurl the greataxe off of the ship.  The cry of anguish that is drawn from her body is reminiscent of the one her mother made many years ago, but it is eclipsed by the sound of the ice creaking and the ship slipping free.

Cold grips you, but no vision floods to your mind's eye.

<p>The a pale pink byssine gown with petal-layered skirts can be customized in the following manner, where any talented merchant can customize the bolded sections.  Note that customizations cannot use speech:
  (STAND) Standing primly you fluff the fabric of your gown out until it drapes down in a perfectly smooth and unblemished fashion.</p>

<p>(PUSH) You push your hands down against your gown in an elegant gesture.</p>

<p>(PULL) You pull the lower portion of a pale pink byssine gown with petal-layered skirts up slightly, displaying your legs.  With a great deal of gumption, you move your feet in an intricate dance that leaves you breathless.  As you finish, your fingers release the gown's fabric.</p>

<p>(CURTSY) You dip your body, pulling the lower portion of a pale pink byssine gown with petal-layered skirts out to either side of you so that the fabric drapes down like a gentle mist around your feet.  As you complete the formal curtsy you rise to your feet.</p>

<p>(SMELL) Holding a pale pink byssine gown with petal-layered skirts up to your face, you inhale deeply, and the scent of *morning glories fills your senses.</p>

<p>(KNEEL) You pull the hem of your gown up and back, then kneel in a reverent manner.</p>

<p>(WAVE)  You grasp the fabric of the skirted portion of a pale pink byssine gown with petal-layered skirts and take a single step toward Limorten.  Smiling brilliantly you wave your free hand at [target].
  (WAVE - sitting) Smiling brilliantly at [target], you immediately rise to your feet, careful not to step on the hem of your gown in your quick movements.  You then grasp the fabric of the skirted portion of a pale pink byssine gown with petal-layered skirts and wave your free hand at [target].
  (standing and sitting utilize the same customization wording)</p>

<p>(TAP - worn) You lightly flick your fingernails against the fabric of gown in a gesture that unequivocally expresses your disinterest.
  (TAP - not worn) You trace your fingers along a pale pink byssine gown with petal-layered skirts in a manner that indicates your current disinterest.
  (worn and not worn utilize the same customization wording)</p>

<p>(NUDGE) As you fiddle with your gown, an amused expression crosses your features.</p>

<p>Currently, you are able to use STAND, RUB, PUSH, TURN, SIT, PULL, CURTSY, SMELL, KNEEL, LIE, WEARMSG, REMOVEMSG, WAVE (with target), COVER, SCOWL, POUT, HUG, TAP, TILT, PLUCK, ROLL (with target), and NUDGE.</p>

<p>Its funny because a fully unlocked duplicity cloak would be a top tier win for me, I win a fully unlocked perretta gown.</p></div></article><article id="post-6854" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">amerek</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, October 21st, 2017, 3:35:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>OK, so after hitting the games as hard as I possibly can for 2 weeks, I'm starting to get digging fatigue.</p>

  There appears to be something engraved on the gravemarker.  It reads, "Beyond the Mist ~ Kaight Rests in Peace"

The creator has also provided the following information:
A moonlight silver serpent mask with gold-glaced scales can be detailed with both a long and a show description.  However, the noun cannot be changed, and part of the LOOK has a portion that cannot be altered.  A merchant can help you with changing your mask so that it either covers your entire face; or covers the upper part of your face (including your nose); or covers the upper part of your face (but not your nose).  [Note that this is in regards to the "face," "nose," and, when applicable, the "dmark" feature slots.]  A merchant can help you change what the fastenings look like, though they must remain something that logically ties (cording, ribbons, strings, etc.).</p>

<p>A moonlight silver serpent mask with gold-glaced scales can be customized in the following manner, where any talented merchant can customize the bolded sections.  Note that customizations cannot use speech.  (* preceeding any phrasing indicates customized phrasing is in use on this particular item.)</p>

<p>(NUDGE (cover face)) employing a mysterious manner, you position your serpent mask to cover your face and tighten its fastenings.</p>

<p>(NUDGE (uncover face)) smiling cryptically, you loosen the fastenings of your serpent mask and pull it down, revealing your face.</p>

<p>(RAISE) You adjust your serpent mask ever so slightly, drawing attention to *subtle sneer stretching across your lips.</p>

<p>(TWITCH) Your fingertips trail over the edge of your serpent mask as your lips twitch up in an enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>(BOW) Contemplating [target] from behind your mask, you incline your head *slowly, almost mockingly.
    ==This item is set up to "bow" but a willing merchant can change it to use "curtsy" for some of its messaging instead.==</p>

<p>(TURN (1st person)) Peering out from behind your mask, you are awash with *bloodlust as your eyes sweep over [target].
 (TURN (3rd person)) Peering out from behind her mask, Nanag's eyes *sparkle with bloodthirsty intention as they sweep over [target].</p>

<p>(STRETCH) You stretch your mouth into *a sinuous smile, grateful that your mask hides the full weight of your expression.</p>

<p>(ATTEND) From behind the perceived security of your mask, you gaze at [target] with *careful wariness.</p>

<p>Currently, you are able to use BOW (with target), TURN (with target), FLUTTER, OBSERVE, POINT (with target), STRETCH, PUSH, ATTEND (with target), COVER, TWIST, NUDGE, RAISE, and TWITCH.</p>

<p>For targets, you may need to (verb) mask AT/WITH (target).  This only works for interacting with other individuals, not creatures or items.</p></div></article><article id="post-6902" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 23rd, 2017, 11:37:17 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>nice, fully unlocked duplicity mask!</p></div></article><article id="post-6912" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Palcron</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, October 24th, 2017, 5:12:53 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>5x golvern MBP  and a +27 hoarbeam crossbow - both t5's and neither is special in any way outside of the alter (they don't even have a show).
