<li>August more than likely. That is extremely tentative though. That's just following the same lineup as last year. It won't carry into September though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wyrom, PM</p>

<ul>
<li>August is a very packed month this year. We'd likely be looking at August 18th to the 27th. Again, tentative. Things can change from now until then. There are others who contribute to the final say.</li>

<p>Good point.  Although should we be worried about their value as far as silver to be made by players?  I'd suggest that maybe the focus for them should just be to lighten and deepen our own stuff.  I would think the original intent on releasing them was more so to take the burden off of GM's from having to do it so often, freeing them up to do other things that can't be done through certs, vs. giving the player base a way to earn more silvers.

<p>Yes, we should be worried about their value.  Because after everyone has used all the L/D to maximize their gear, what purpose do they serve then?  That's one less reward they can offer at events like Delirium Manor. (Which has low value rewards besides the notes.)  I agree that it helps to remove the burden from GM's, but you don't want to overdo it.</p>

<p>They also tend to run merchants who offer epic lighten and deepen during Duskruin for bloodscrip.</p></div></article><article id="post-1155" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">peam</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 11th, 2017, 9:25:01 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I think this will be the first Duskruin or similar event I actually participate in.</p>

<p>Silvers are not made by players for those L/D notes, it is transferred from player to player.</p>

<p>I also hope it is not dropped at Duskruin.  And if it was, that it is rare and NOT only found in the sewers.</p>

<p>The automatons/ rare metals were not a significant drop and the pendants have dropped for awhile now.  It may make more bloodscrip, but the arena can use love in loot too!  I am curious on how the 3 vs 3 impacts bloodscrip reward and time to complete.</p></div></article><article id="post-1192" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 11th, 2017, 12:35:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Don't worry guys, we're rescheduling the eclipse.</p></div></article><article id="post-1193" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 11th, 2017, 12:36:12 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ososis said in <a href="/post/1162">Event: Duskruin - August 2017</a>:</p>

<p>But there's no way to make it perfect. The eclipse is on the 21st. The most important part of Duskruin is the opening, which is on the night of the 18th. You should be able to do both. Otherwise, it runs for 10 days, and the eclipse lasts about an hour and a half.  Not really a big deal in terms of overlap.</p>

<p>Typically the first x hours of the event allow for the purchase of high end items without price increase increments for purchases.  So all 7000 people can buy the extra 59 point of padding certs for 1k each before they start to get their increase of 700k per purchase.</p></div></article><article id="post-1218" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 11th, 2017, 1:38:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I bet a lot more people are going away for Labor Day</p></div></article><article id="post-1222" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 11th, 2017, 1:42:12 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli said in <a href="/post/1218">Event: Duskruin - August 2017</a>:</p>

<p>Yeah, I just don't care about the eclipse. I get outside plenty on a normal basis and encourage regular escapes from the keyboard.  </p>

<p>If some big gymnastics meet (an event that I would actually be interested in) was that weekend, I wouldn't expect scheduling to be done around that or get so upset as to encourage others not to support the game or have their fun in it, or say the event had better not be scheduled at the same time as the 2024 Olympics, because that's ridiculous.</p>

    <p>We overlapped Labor Day last year.  It was a bad decision.  SimuCon was last weekend, if it wasn't, we could have MAYBE did it this weekend.  There will always be something though.  Sorry to those that want to travel for the eclipse.  I am a space nerd, but I'm cool with the 90% I can get here.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Agreed. There will ALWAYS be something.  You constantly schedule this in the middle of my busiest tax months. I hate you. I still manage to spend $1,000+.  Maybe if you scheduled it when it was the most convenient to me, I would spend $2,000!  Oh wait, I'm sure something else would be going on too. :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a more serious note, I see a lot of people make this event quite profitable for them. How do they do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ordim gave the tl;dr version of it, I'll give a little more verbose.</p>

<p>I can buy a booket for lets say 6m.</p>

<p>A booklet contains 50 tickets.</p>

<p>I'm pretty good, I have a nice bow.  My bow has a nice quiver.  Everything is nice.  Know what's not as shiney as the bow?  Critters in the arena.</p>

<p>If you can absolutely dominate the arena, you can earn 250 blood scrip per entry.  Unusually an occasional 232 or so, but pretty much 250.</p>

<p>The price for silvers::bloodscrip is roughly determined by the sewers, which people can basically just loot pinata.  You can get 150ish blood scrip per entry.  It's really 100, but you get a bunch of garbage to trade for more BS, because it's BS, so you can end up with 100-150 super quickish.  </p>

<p>So, if you just do the sewers, lets go ahead and say you'll end up with about 6k bloodscrip with 50 entries.  Not bad!
If I'm in the arena, I'll likely be pulling out of there with about 12k bloodscrip.</p>

<p>Bloodscrip pricing is ROUGHLY based on this, further modified by ebs and flows over the duration of the event.  A rule of thumb of 1k per 1 BS yields 6m and 12m rates of returns on sewers versus arena.  Therefore if we assume it's costing you about 6m per 50 entries.  Well, if I max the arena, I'm walking away with a 6m profit.  Which I can then turn around, buy TWO entry booklets, and rinse/repeat to make even more profits.</p></div></article><article id="post-1793" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 7:44:51 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@god said in <a href="/post/1767">Event: Duskruin - August 2017</a>:</p>

I'll have more details before we go live, but I just don't want to make sure everything in QC is accurate before doing that.</p>

<p>Dates</p>

<p>The event will start on the 18th, but we're going to extend the event until the end of the month. Slips and tokens will not be available after 11pm (ish) ET on the 30th. We'll leave the event open throughout the 31st for purely shopping. The extension is mainly for shopping, but with the solar eclipse happening on the 21st, we're going to give people a few extra days who might be traveling for that.</p>

<p>Arena
* 3 vs 3 matches.
<em>* Can also do 2 vs 2 matches.
*</em> Prizes are individual, but group benefits from winning.
** New drop will be available for certain service (vague on purpose).</p>

<p>Sewers
* New bloodrunes.
* Upped rate of caches (still very rare).</p>

<p>Shops
* Book shop will be back.
* New Spellbound x/day items. We're adding a bunch of offensive spells for the new magic item use updates.
* Custom (premade) bolt messaging.
* Unlock certificates you can REDEEM.
* Slab roulette (from EG) will be here for bloodscrip.
* New Illusion pins.
* New high end scrip shop offerings.
<em>* This is something I really want to make sure is through QC before revealing.
*</em> Weighting/Padding will not be in the scrip shop. It will be handled a new way.
* New shops.
** More on these when they exit QC.</p>

<p>Titles
* New permanent titles unlocked at certain levels of play. Tracking started April 2017. Some of you will have a lot of them going into this run.</p>

<p>I know I'm forgetting something, but I want to make sure you guys have some information before I go to bed.</p>

<p>Enchant certificates are not returning this run. That was announced several times last run. Voln Armor unlock, Splitters, AsG changes, Animated Cauldron, and the censor are all items that are 100% retired.</p>

<p>I think the stuff they plan to automate is just being described as not this run etc.  Like enchanting and Some of the flares, once they get the scaling costs ironed out (I really want ironwright, for instance, but at plain 6x price, not 10x MCW rotflares price).</p></div></article><article id="post-1828" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 7:47:54 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>They were announced retiring with a wink wink nudge nudge "but we are working very hard on making them all certificate/scaling based on the item/unlock level!" which they are delivering on in some areas, just not everything all at once.

<p>I am referencing much older posts than the one within the past few days.

<p>While I get what you're saying, there are a few reasons why we rotate items.  When I say retire, I mostly mean rotate.  There are a few things that are 100% retired though, like the enchant certificates, VolnArmor unlock, Splitter service, and Dark and Dangerous.  I'd rather move the VolnArmor (and other tiered out mechanical releases) to some other events. 
 Duskruin is a good venue for it, but offering things in unlimited quantities can get tough to balance.  </p>

<p>We know what's out there for bloodscrip (roughly), so when we offer something, we have an idea of what can be bought at the start and end of the event.  But we also don't want to make it where a snowball effect happens and people might not buy anything last event, but then suddenly they buy dozens to hundreds of something and catch us off guard.  Each run has to get balanced.</p>

<p>As for your comment on our failure, it's more to do about investing my time into areas that are getting used.  Would we rather create new arena mechanics or more automated redeeming mechanics?  I chose to add new fun to this run.  We're definitely trying to add more automation where we can.  But just to suck it up and deal with it just leads to burn out.

<p>It would be helpful if this was communicated the first time. This also isn't the first time where meaning is inconsistent between internal and customer side (w/ regard to "retire"). There are several things that come together on this. Enchants - People are still expecting more player options for enchant similar to what ensorcell can do. It was again hinted at but never expressly told "no dont ever expect that" or "we are working on it". Dark and Dangerous - It was clear from the final answer (after at least one start and stop on correcting it) that the 6x HCP/W armor/weapons weren't coming back, so no issues there. Voln, splitter were, for me, lumped in with the "we want to scale the price based on the item". If they will see increased chances elsewhere, that's acceptable and my problem for not have gotten it "easy" for whatever it would have cost to buy the booklets.</p>

<p>I know you mostly mean well but this something that I feel you've already lost any grounds on. Early on you posted that the limiting factors were how much people were willing to spend and the scaling process. There was surprise at how successful it was and what people were willing to pay. A large part of me wants to say "Take your lumps, you let the genie out of the bottle" and the other part is sympathetic towards the game as a whole. While it's fun to get the best stuff it also begins the cycle of power creep and demand for something new etc. </p>

<p>On top of that, there are people who do slowly build up and save up for the larger ticket items. It's not too dissimilar from the arcade prize analogy, except the prizes are always changing and you may not want something THAT run but now you have to wait until you come back and hope there is a prize you DO want. Where as someone might have been happy just getting the base script of something on the armor ASG best for their character. I don't deny there is a lot of different situations that might need to be thought of, so it's certainly not an envious task. </p>

<p>The disconnect then is why it is so difficult to make a very similar object (why can't it just be cut and paste and replace the name and adjust the scaling numbers?) and if it's not bought you are out a few minutes of item creation (why not reuse the item from last time?) and if it IS bought the effort of actually working on the item is justified by the cost. I get that you have an NDA, so with that in mind, UP VOTE MY POST IF THE TERRIBLE CODING LANGUAGE IS HOLDING YOU HOSTAGE you don't have to say it, JUST UP VOTE MY POST. Otherwise - work smarter not harder, change the system etc. Look, we, I, don't know what you guys are dealing with. But as a paying customer, I don't ever want to hear the person I am paying say "You better buy this because it was a real burden for me to put a price tag on it".</p>

<p>I'll close by saying that while I may be a vocal complainer, I'm generally very happy with the game as a whole and only try to shine a light on the parts that I think should be "easy wins" for making things better. I try to point out greatness just as much as I point out things that aren't so great. Keep up the good work.</p></div></article><article id="post-1966" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 10:02:57 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim Excellent post.

<p>Agreed and understood. And that opens a whole new discussion in some regards, but the concept of "unlock an item with another item" is proven. It's more the "What do we charge for unlocking 1 tier of something on 10x HCP armor vs 4x plain armor?" and the answer to that previously was "Price for the 10x HCP". 
I'm comfortable waiting for unlocking on tier (Which I feel SHOULD be the end game to free up more GM time for other stuff, like the Bank heist in DR....)  but it misses the point of taking something away because it wasn't a popular item and then toss out an excuse like </p>

<p>because while I held off on saying it before, that almost becomes a bait and switch at that point. The big unknown (on the player side, and maybe even the GM side) is what percentage of people save up BS vs spending it all at the same event they earn it, indicating that they are either saving up for something big or were not interested in the items presented to them at the time.</p></div></article><article id="post-1993" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Luxelle</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 1:51:33 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim said in <a href="/post/1963">Event: Duskruin - August 2017</a>:</p>

He and I don't always agree, but I think the conversation is pretty respectful both ways most of the time.  The simucoin system, (and let's face it, the alt-currencies and alt-currency events are an extension of the simucoin system), is still new.  While Wyrom deserves some time to sort out the details, feedback like Ordim's is vital to helping him do that, even if it seems a little blunt sometimes.</p>

<p>I can see your argument. And we can probably all agree that if we are to be respectful and aware of GM time constraints, we will all work harder to make our communication with them more efficient, by doing stuff like boiling down our thoughts into a small digestible nugget, receive reply, form perhaps one additional response, and move on. I don't think that @Wyrom or anyone else is looking to get dragged into one or more endless conversations / ego-based / otherwise-inefficient pissing matches. </p>

<p>Either way, it's nice to have these forums as an outlet for direct GM communication. Huge step forward.

<p>I think the disconnect here is that I've seen this conversation multiple times and his responses. It's possible you haven't seen them because the communication has been scattered throughout the officials, in game, and also on PC forums. So it looks to me like you are just beating a dead horse, when perhaps a different reason is you've not seen his responses to these questions.</p>

<p>Going to answer a few questions and concerns that came up in various areas here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>X/day charges</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I forgot to add that all the new x/day items are 20 charges. So they will be pretty useful, compared to something only good for 1 or 2 charges.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TITLES</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I forgot to mention that the temporary titles are completely gone this run. We added 19 permanent postname titles and 6 prename titles. All your accomplishments from April will go toward unlocking these titles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High End Scrip Shop: Prices</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few things here when we go into the pricing. The biggest concerns are always things like over-availability. We experiment a lot when it comes to pricing. Not just with pay events. But for Duskruin specifically, we try to let the market control itself, which is really hard to do. We get one shot to handle it properly. Look at Dark and Dangerous as an example of what can go wrong. Whether you think the price was fair or not, look at how we struggled with that one.</p>

<p>There is also a sense of panic when we release something we weren't confident to release in large quantities. After each run, we look at the numbers that sold and decide if we want to roll the dice again. Not in all cases we feel comfortable with giving it another try. We do not look at banked bloodscrip as a pricing structure for items. And millions aren't accumulated on single characters or even players. The circulation of bloodscrip isn't that deep.</p>

<p>Item pricing in the Scrip Shop is also not intended to be flipped in many cases. You look at the market in the beginning of the event, and yeah, those prices are tough to swallow if you're buying bloodscrip from other players. I saw people using 1500 silver per bloodscrip in a discussion. But come next week, it drops to under 1000 per bloodscrip. Every run has been the same. This is very normal in limited markets. Not just in this game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High End Scrip Shop: Rotate vs. Retire</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like I'm being confusing here, because I'm inside my own head when I talk about these things. Part of the reasons are described above why we might retire something. But one thing I know I'm not being clear on is rotating. That's on me and I apologize for that. Mostly rotate means to rotate to another event. Sometimes we might rotate them back into Duskruin after we solved why we pulled them in the first place.</p>

<p>I'll use two examples of items that feel good at Duskruin, but it's tough to solve the release distribution. VolnArmor and IthzirArmor. Both are high demand unlocks. Armor can have a lot of properties. Enchant, padding, TD, AS bonus, bless, flares, spikes, banes, temp (everything), and a bunch of other very specific things. We generally have to price things with many of those properties in mind. When we move into more automation, we have to account for it. We were going to try for that this run, but it's a lot of stuff, and it just didn't make it into the final production of Duskruin. Those two services are a bit better when we limit offerings by other means (raffles, auction, spinners, etc). Until we can solve that component, it's hard to offer those things at Duskruin at a price point that is more appealing to a wider variety of players.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Item Limits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Scrip Shop has a one certificate per item rule, but the weighting, padding, and sighting area is not part of that. And the 25 services per item will make sense when more information is released there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Closing Notes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know the way I post sometimes comes off as arrogant to some of you. I'm not an arrogant man. I'm very humbled to be honest. I work on this game because I want to see it prosper. I work at all staffing levels personally and I'm very hands on. When I post something that you feel should not be said by the Product Manager, it's not that I'm being snide. I'm being honest with you. I don't sugar coat it or manipulate the words. Sure I spend some time choosing my words, but I rather be honest with you and myself. I could do what other companies do and have my responses go through some sort of QC and approval (if you didn't know that, now you do), but it would likely stifle communications pretty severely.</p>

<p>I know people don't play this game specifically for Duskruin. There are things you enjoy with GemStone IV outside this. If this event disgusts you or a specific aspect of this event disgusts you, I hope there is still enjoyment elsewhere in the game. I feel that we have people who get upset that OTHER people will buy items or have fun. I never understand that mindset, but it's real.</p>

<p>I want you guys to have fun. Focus on what is fun for you. Ignore the rest! Good words to live by even outside this game.</p>

  <p>TLDR; Too much banked bloodscrip means prices are going to continue to increase, which means less people see value, which means more banked or less participation and profit, creating a really bad cycle which will lead to failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I debunked this in my previous post, but this is not why prices on some things are high. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You're offering greater elemental flare certificates, but they require the weapon to already be flared. That means for people like me who planned to add it to a plain high enchant weapon, this is no longer an option. Certificates should just add the service without any of the pre-reqs. Voln armor was another example of a failed certificate because of the required pre-reqs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure I follow this one. This was just announced. Who was planning anything? The item just needs to have the flaring spot available here. We can see about offering a removal service at some point.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope. De-fusuon still is there though.</p>

<p>The forging slabs are separate from the arena ores. This works strictly like they worked at Ebon Gate, for bloodscrip. It was requested, we fulfilled that request.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't think this fully explains why other people are upset, I think it's more that if you do not enjoy Duskruin, and do not enjoy the rat race for bloodscrip, and just wish you could use your silvers to get high end services like padding, flares, etc., you can't. That's not possible anymore. If people aren't interested in participating in this event or scrambling in the secondary market for BS, they've been effectively shut out of all opportunities for high-end services. Yes, there was the auction last year, but that was the first time in 8 years(?) and it was mostly all items. Yes, there is SimuCon, but you have to travel to St. Louis. The obstacles are real. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We still offer high end services and items outside pay events. The difference is we have 6 pay events each year, instead of 2 or 3 like previous years. We offer more now outside pay events than we ever did before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the increased cost of high-end items doesn't have to do with banked bloodscrip, but controlling availability? I don't understand how the increased cost does that when there's a limit put on the certificates available. It just makes the items less accessible to more people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing is getting gradually more expensive. Like Undead Bane, for example, has been that price since we offered it.</p>

<p>It's the same when we spin for 1 winner, we still control the availability. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've never seen a calendar item for Ithzir unlocking. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>IthzirArmor and VolnArmor are not very available at anything. RtCF/CCF really was the last time we offered those.</p>

<p>What I was saying is, we haven't stopped offering allotments of services at any other non-pay event venue.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm not sure what the "who was planning anything?" refers to, but I said I was planning to put it on a runestaff, and the OP said he was planning on a high enchant plain weapon. While the service was just announced, we do think about what we're going to do with items way in advance. I've been sitting on this staff for about 2 years and awesome non-acuity flares (bc I already have those) were high up on the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was a pretty last minute addition that MEKK1 suggested. My response was directed at the quote though. "I was planning on doing this on X item." But the announcement was the first time it was shown. Not sure how anyone planned that to even be a service.</p>

<p>As for the item needing flares, that was more it has to have those flares to even work. You can't have a blessable greater elemental flaring weapon.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>that's not true, both were offered at EG last year. Part of why I put in all of the effort to make the list is to track things like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I meant in larger quantities. VolnArmor was released at RtCF.</p>

  <p>Re: ClimateWear tier 3 unlock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, price adjusted to 20,000 bloodscrip. Still price scaling and limited though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't understand why the high defense. The troll is obviously in offensive stance. Let alone, he is disarmed. Is there any chance to make this a bit more fair and realistic if this is intentional please?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trolls are intended to be a tougher creature for melee/ranged. Spellcasters also have tough creatures. There are tactics you can use to bring down their DS.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the topic of bugs though, two times last night I saw my script set me up to dodge the attack of a snow crone then instantly got pushed into said trap. The first was a torch and the second was a spiked pit. Happened back to back, I don't recall ever getting nailed by a trap after getting setup to dodge it in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing changed with traps, only that on the user end, a specific script is not working as it once did. Traps become frequent once a creature is injured. In a team match, this means it could be 3 times faster.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Quality of Life requests for the arena:</p>
  
  <p>1) Can you put the 'round 2' etc. notice after we've killed a creature - the screen scroll makes it very hard to see the round number after the critter walks into the room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try using the CombatBrief flag to help with scroll.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) Can you have the janitor clean the room before the next combatant arrives? When people leave arrows on the ground, this causes a lot of confusion for archers who use different arrows.</p>

<p>This was the case until we gave a QoL improvement to help archers recover their arrows. Prior to that update, the room was cleaned up entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question:</p>
  
  <p>With regard to eye criticals - is a rank 3 eye crit always meant to cause a rank 3 head crit as well? It seems like this should be a bug, since they are in two different locations. This is important because if I "miss their eyes"(i.e., I induce a rank 3 on both eyes without killing them), I cannot aim for the head any more either. Issue is for champions mostly. Seems like a bug, but is this intentional? I apologize if this is written elsewhere, I cannot search this forum efficiently.</p>

<p>Yes. Both occur. </p>

I did not have a feature concealing hood before.</p>

<p>Here is the analyze from my item now:</p>

<p>The creator has also provided the following information:</p>

<p>The grey ramie silk longcloak is a garment that changes messaging depending on the climate you're in, or whether it is raining/snowing outside.  This item can be altered, it just needs to remain the basic essence of what the item is (no changing a cloak into a dress, but a cloak into a coat is fine).</p>

<p>The longcloak is fully unlocked with feature concealer ability.  It has 16 verbs.
  This is currently set to be a cloak of some sort.
  The longcloak is currently hooded with the following custom hood: silver-lined grey hood.
  The longcloak currently has the following for custom fastenings: dark blue tempest stone clasp.
  The longcloak currently has the following for custom pockets: small silver-lined pocket (a small pocket), large silver-lined pocket (a large pocket),  (small scabbards), ebon leather weapon loops (weapon loops),  (large pouches), and  (small pouches).</p>

<p>You can tell that the longcloak is as light as it can get and that its pockets could not possibly get any deeper.</p></div></article><article id="post-2423" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 19th, 2017, 7:17:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The ;midnightarena script has been updated and should prove far more reliable.

<p>There seems to be confusion with people regarding climatewear and as someone who has spent a lot of time and money in past ones, I'll try to break it down. </p>

<p>Feature concealing is ONLY available with the full T3 climatewear with 16 verbs. This is the unlock that costs 20k. You cannot get this feature at a lower unlock tier. </p>

<p>The custom hood is available at lower unlock tiers. This is NOT feature concealing. It is a custom feature for your climatewear, much like buttons, pockets, etc. When you <em>PUSH</em> or <em>PULL</em> your climatewear piece, you'll see your designed hood in the script instead of just something dull and boring. That is what the cheaper unlock is for, so you can get it altered. Options are hood or cowl.</p></div></article><article id="post-2462" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Xannorath</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 20th, 2017, 9:31:38 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@maetriks

<p>Yeah, that's still true.  If the event stays open, the booklets and jars would no longer be on sale.  I'll be sure to post all the details as soon as I can.  Unfortunately, missing a critical system update when we thought we were good to go has caused a lot more work and stress on everyone.  Typically, something to the magnitiude that needed to be updated would be a month or two out.  So pushing it through in a week has been a challenge.
We're very close though.</p>

<p>One thing that may have been lost in the chaos is we made it where you can get a second invite due to the delay.  The original plan was 1 invite and that was it.  We'll see how it goes where people can earn another (after they use their's) to see if we'll leave as is for next time.
Also, weighting/padding will be available soon after Duskruin for silver as well.
If you hate the price in bloodscrip, just wait for the silver way.</p>

<p>Well, the booklet sale for silver also tapped the majority of players in game. Since it was not planned and no one was grinding for months to get silver. It drained the "middle class" of Elanthia pretty well. </p>

<p>The rich will always be rich.  That's how it works.
We're at about 2.2billion silver drained from booklets alone.</p>

<p>Players also haven't recovered from the auction in 2016 yet either.  So if we use December 2016 as a start date, we've pulled more silver out of game than we've introduced.</p>

<p>I think part of the hysteria is something I also instilled a bit by exposing some of the numbers.  And I know Kerl on the forums has some good points.  But he's mostly touching on players not selling anything.  Not that we're not selling anything. It's tough though, because when people tie up ROI into a game, things get pretty doomed quickly.</p></div></article><article id="post-3701" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 10:04:01 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I appreciate what he's saying.

<p>That's either a generous bump in silver value or a large drop in BS value perception.</p></div></article><article id="post-3714" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 11:11:19 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I beleive he more specifically said they were picking a silver price, and other currencies be damned.</p></div></article><article id="post-3715" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 11:15:33 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex said in <a href="/post/3714">Official: Duskruin - August 2017</a>:</p>

<p>I have no problem with that, as long as it holds consistent for a period of time and doesn't fluctuate with the secondary market.

<p>They should be careful about devaluing their pay event though.</p>

<p>Pay events should be the cheapest options, with silvers costing more, not less.  Otherwise, what incentive is there to participate in the pay event?</p></div></article><article id="post-3718" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 11:32:38 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You know what, i spent a lot more time on this than I should have.

<p>History says that in game silver prices usually ignore the secondary market.</p></div></article><article id="post-3733" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 1:50:28 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Smithy is open.</p></div></article><article id="post-3736" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 1:55:06 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Not exactly.

<p>Estild - The amount of weighting/padding on the item is not a factor.  All factors being the same, the 1st service costs the same as the 5000th service, if no surcharge is added for multiple services during a 60 day service window.  But if you price adding damage weighting when the item has critical weighing, the latter is a factor for the price (and vice versa).</p></div></article><article id="post-3828" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 10:28:41 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>"Amount of weighting/padding is not a factor" is true in the sense of cost per point, but what is gained with the first ten points is not the same as what is gained with points 4726-4736.

<p>Correct.  There was some information floating around that there was a "double penalty" in that it scaled twice (three times if you count the 60-day window).  The post was only to clarify that the cost won't change for the first point as you go up the scale (And quotes shared confirm this, 6x HCW gear is the same price as 6x gear for point 1).</p></div></article><article id="post-3921" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 9:50:25 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Quote from GM Coase: http://forums.play.net/forums/GemStone%20IV/Paid%20Events:%20Adventures,%20Quests,%20and%20SimuCoins/Duskruin%20Arena/view/8061</p>

<p>If you were overcharged by the smithy, you'll need to ASSIST so that we can check out your circumstances and refend appropriately. There was a pricing bug for the first 30 minutes or so where you were being charged for the wrong step and another where you were incorrectly allowed to purchase more than 25 services (which is easy to miss if you're buying a lot all at once).</p>
