* At the blacksmith, you can add SP.  (Up to 25 at Duskruin).
* Look at the chart and find where 25 SP would be.  (Between 20-30)
* Since 25 is between 20-30, you're stuck at the bonus offered at 20.
* Look to the left of the 20 SP row, it will have the number of PP you'll get.  (2)
* Look to the right of the PP column, and you'll see that at 20 SP or 2 PP, you'll have "Lightly" WPS weapon/armor.</p>

<p>If you already have a WPS weapon or armor.
* Find the name of your padding level (heavily) and look to the right.
* You'll see that HCP is either 9 or 10 PP.
* Look to the right again, and you'll see that 9 or 10 PP is either 130 or 150 SP.
* You'll be able to add 25 SP using the blacksmith.</p>

Examining the armor closely, it looks like it is fairly padded, lessening the damage the wearer takes.</p>

<p>That's what I thought, too. Then I counted the success messages in Notepad++. Got 26 services.</p>

  Assess moved over to using scale values and because of that, the gaps in between in between two assess ranks go to the higher reading even though the combat effectiveness has not moved up yet. I'll address this with my assess changes.</p>

<p>Voln has, and is based upon how many unlocks the armor has. Ithzir hasn't yet, as it's still being reviewed.</p>
