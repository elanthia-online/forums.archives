<p>We are nearing the end of the QC for the updates. Information will be available soon.</p>

<p>As for smithy invites, originally we were going to be limiting these to only being able to obtain one per Duskruin event (separate from certificates). We changed that due to the delay. I realize there won't be as much time to earn a second one, but you will have the option once the smithy is opened.</p>

<p>problem is we don't know.  I'm running low on entries, so last night I considered whether or not to buy SCs, and I decided to not and wait for the release.</p></div></article><article id="post-3206" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 3:59:28 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Wyrom posted <a href="http://forums.play.net/forums/GemStone%20IV/Paid%20Events:%20Adventures,%20Quests,%20and%20SimuCoins/Duskruin%20Arena/view/7616">Re: smithy</a></p>

<p>To clarify invites, they are intended to be rare. They weren't intended for everyone to get one. They are an added bonus to your arena wins. Winning an arena match has a small chance to get an invite, getting a perfect win (250 bloodscrip) ups the chances by x10. Doing a quick look, I see about 70% of all arena goers having earned one at this point.</p>
