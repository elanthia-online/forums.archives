An announcer shouts, "Round 23, send in another one!"  An iron portcullis is raised and a horned kobold servant enters the arena!</p>

<p>You appraise the situation and notice the kobold servant may push you into a lit torch, you could try to duck down!</p>

<p>You set yourself up to duck out of the kobold servant's way!</p>

I haven't appraised them to gauge their level, but that could be a factor.</p>

<p>I understand RNG adding chaos and failures/fumbles, but 10 seconds to fail when a success is only 6 seconds seems ridiculous, at least in the arena. The log above is a full 30 seconds I got nothing done.</p></div></article><article id="post-2385" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 19th, 2017, 1:33:32 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Ambush is a poorly developed skill IMO. It punishes those who are at low level inappropriately, and eventually moves to having no penalties at all other than the oddities you pointed out.

I'm a capped warrior with max Ambush, and the arena is the only place in the game I encounter critters that I fail to find an opening to strike. I've never failed on bandits.
