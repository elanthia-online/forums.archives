In order to promote a marmot-friendly environment, I will now reveal a couple of these roles so you can have an idea of what to expect:</p>

<p><strong>Ticking Marmot</strong>
This marmot has eaten a <em>bomb</em>. The detonator to this bomb has been lost, but upon the ticking marmot's death, there is a chance that the ticking marmot will <strong>explode</strong>. Upon the ticking marmot's death, there is a 50% chance that the marmot will not explode. There is also a 50% chance that the marmot will explode and take someone with it. In the event of a marmot explosion, a roll will be taken to decide who is taken out with the marmot out of the marmots who were involved in it's death. This includes all living players in the event of a townsmarmot lynching; not just townsmarmots/marmotfia that voted for this marmot. This is a townsmarmot role.</p>

<p><strong>Marmot Bard</strong>
This marmot is a very important marmot to the game. The Marmot Bard has no special powers at all, but this marmot may only speak in rhymes. This can be either a marmotfia or townsmarmot role. In a rare, double whammy decision, this role may potentially be paired with another role so as not to give away who does <em>not</em> have a power.</p></div></article><article id="post-4958" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 12th, 2017, 8:30:28 AM</div></div><div class="content"><ol>

Hurry! There are <em>marmots</em>.</p>

<p>Here are two more of the possible roles:</p>

<p><strong>Flatulent Marmot</strong>
This marmot has smelly marmot farts. The smelly marmot farts may be directed at another marmot during the day. If the marmot who has the smelly farts on them utilizes a role, the Flatulent marmot will know what power was used because the flatulent marmot can recognize his or her own brand. Alternatively, this marmot can choose to not to put smelly marmot farts on anyone. If this choice is taken, and a marmafia attempt to kill this marmot is made during the night, there is a 25% chance that the Flatulent marmot lives through the night because his marmot house was too smelly for the Marmafia to enter. This is a townsmarmot role.</p>

<p>And I know some of these roles may seem a little...squirrely, but I can bearly contain myself from revealing this other potential role (Get it?! Because a Giant Marmot is kind of like a squirrel crossed with a bear!!!):</p>

<p><strong>The Marmfather</strong>
This marmot is the boss of the Marmfia. And because he or she is somebody's father, based on my loose understanding of the works of Francis Ford Coppola, he or she must make at least one Dad joke during Marmfia scheming on each night cycle. This is why all the other marmots look up to him or her, and is the source of all his or her powers, so if the Marmfather fails to make a Dad joke during scheming, his or her power does not work. That power is that the Marmfather investigates as a Townsmarmot by some form of Marmot detective. So pretty much the Godfather role if you're familiar with forum Mafia. But with Marmots. And Dad Jokes.</p>

<p>Also, all dad jokes joked by the Marmfather are required to be read in the rest of the Marmfia's head in Marlon Brando's voice. This is done on the honor system.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
