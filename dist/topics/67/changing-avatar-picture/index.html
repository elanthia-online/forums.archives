<p>Also, just tried to upload a picture of my dog Dude and kept getting a parsing server error.. is there a limit to the size of picture?  I assume it's fine, taken from an iPhone and not enlarged or anything.</p></div></article><article id="post-360" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 12:17:16 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This forum really likes internet cache.

<p>Something is wonky with it.</p>

<p>I don't understand when you delete the image from user side, it somehow keeps it there though.  Something is wonky.  I doubt you want to be inundated with people requesting you change their avatar when that should be a rather simple user ability.</p></div></article><article id="post-452" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 7:02:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Agreed.  We'll test it out and try to recreate.  Same browser was used that I am using.

<p>I was using Chrome and I was able to set my initial avatar easily.. it was changing it from one to another that posed the issue.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
