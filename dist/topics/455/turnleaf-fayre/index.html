<p>The leaves are turning on the Sylvanfair tree!  Join us for our annual weekend-long Fayre in the Sylvanfair Grove to mark the occasion.  Starting at 6.00PM, on the Day of the Huntress, the 22nd day of Imaerasta (<strong>Friday 22nd September</strong>), you are invited to help us prepare for the festivities by making some decorative garlands.  Someone will be on hand to teach you how to weave some of the autumn-themed bits and pieces we have gathered especially for the occasion.</p>

<p>On Feastday the 23rd day of Imaerasta (<strong>Saturday 23rd September</strong>) at 2.00PM, we are delighted to welcome a guest speaker from Elanthian Elegance who will be talking about some of the techniques for creating original and beautiful, nature-inspired designs.  This will be followed by a few friendly rounds of the ever-popular Greedy Gremlins at 4.00PM.</p>

<p>We will be holding two raffles towards the closing end of the Fayre to commemorate the changing of the seasons, so be sure to stop by the Grove and buy your tickets.  The first raffle is for a shrub with trimming shears for the horticulturists among you and the second is for a full set of weavable tools complete with belt.  Tickets for both raffles will go on sale when the Fayre opens on the Day of the Huntress and draw during the afternoon of Restday, the 24th day of Imaerasta (<strong>Sunday 24th September</strong>).</p>

<p>Later that evening, you are welcome to relax with us in the Grove and share some stories and poems about Imaera to end the festivities.  We'll be gathering at 7.00PM and enjoying hot chocolate around the fire while watching the leaves turn.</p>

<p>Don't forget to pick up your <a href="https://gswiki.play.net/House_Sylvanfair#Events">collectible door prize</a> at any of the events during the weekend too and have a chance to win BIG at the end of the year!</p></div></article><article id="post-4653" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Eva</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 7:44:28 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Looks great!
