Not so long ago, I was having a discussion with a friend about "ideal" (read: perceived, as this is open to individual interpretation) improvements for Rogue Guild skills, and I had a small brainstorm.</p>

<p>Of all the classes in GS, I feel that Rogues (and possibly Rangers) would be ideally suited to creating traps in a room, rather like the ones used in the SMR by Bandits. </p>

<p>This post, is open to brainstorming, creative suggestions and criticisms, etc.
I intend to flesh the concept out further over time, however I recognize this is purely an exercise in creative thinking, and am not holding my breath that any of the concepts discussed here-in, would ever be implimented in any form.</p></div></article><article id="post-28" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Arctal</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, July 23rd, 2017, 6:26:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I would love to see this be implemented, but I'm wondering if it can work with our hunting grounds. </p>

<p>For example, do you set it and wait in the room so it goes off when mobs come in, or do you set it in all the rooms and hit any mobs there?</p></div></article></div></body></html>
