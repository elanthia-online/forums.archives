<p>Agreed.

<p>Agreed. Attempting to cajole the GMs into Xposting every time they say something of note in the Discord isn't going to result in much more information being put on the Officials.

<p>I agree with your fight for proper documentation, when it's relevant.</p>

<p>It doesn't apply to this situation.</p>

<p>The conversation about giftbox items doesn't need to be logged on the wiki.  I would be willing to bet money that there would have been an announcement when the titles were ready.</p>

<p>None of us were saying it should be documented on the wiki.  We just thought it deserved to be posted in an official manner.  Discord is not the place to provide additional details on how the goodie bag will function when there's a ton of us that don't use discord and there's a possibility that Evarin might not cross post.  If you've already posted all the details on the officials and then want to answer people's question, fine, go ahead.  And at the end of that conversation, if more relevant info was released, the GM should go back in and post something on the officials.</p></div></article><article id="post-7402" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 9th, 2017, 11:17:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@viekn said in <a href="/post/7401">Official: Simucon Indiegogo Giftbags Available Now</a>:</p>

<p>Again, you're taking this to the extreme.  Where in this post did anyone mention anything about needing to know everything about everything.  We are talking very specifically Alastir about important information regarding an item that we paid money for being mentioned in casual conversation on a chat site that a significant percentage of people may not use.  I have to imagine if you bought an item from a store, and that store said this item was supposed to include feature XYZ, and when you bought the item it didn't immediately contain feature XYZ or give you information on when you'd get feature XYZ, but if the store posted on their facebook page about feature XYZ, that most people wouldn't be thrilled that it wasn't communicated at the point of purchase instead of facebook.</p></div></article><article id="post-7410" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, November 10th, 2017, 12:23:51 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Official E-mail:</p>

The Goodie Bags have been distributed in GemStone IV, and can be claimed with the GIFTBOX command. If you cannot claim the giftbox, and know you should have one, please send an e-mail to GS4-SLEKEN@play.net, and be sure to include your account name AND the e-mail address you used when contributing through Indiegogo. Additionally, I know some of you still have not received or claimed your auction wins. If you're still pending on that, please e-mail GS4-ZYTHICA@play.net for assistance.</p>

At least that way it will be more widely read (because not everyone reads every chat they've missed when they go back to discord) and if it's seen as something extremely important it could be cross-posted here?</p>

<p>I know there was a bit of confusion of EG where things were said in the discord but never in any other official capacity so it was left up to speculation and conjecture. While I am a huge fan of having as much transparency as possible, we can certainly find better ways of disseminating the information coming out of discord so it reaches the community as a whole without being significantly altered.</p></div></article><article id="post-7423" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Estild</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, November 10th, 2017, 12:15:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Evarin and @Alastir are exactly correct about this situation.  What I posted wasn't any official announcement (however factual it may be).  I saw someone ask about it on Discord and because I knew the answer, I responded.  I was not involved with organizing SimuCon or handling goodie bags this year, so anything I offer up is purely because I'm trying to help and it's not my place to make official announcements regarding it.  If other players want to post on the forums to ask the same questions, they certainly can, then Sleken or Zythica can respond on it.  Even without that, everyone would have learned about what I stated at the time when the titles and second giftbox are available, because those clearly would have been announced. </p>

<p>I'm not going to cross-post everything I state in Discord, because as noted, it is a conversation.  And even if Wyrom told me it was required, that's just going to mean I'm not going to communicate on Discord.  Just the same, I don't expect every conversation I have with every player at SimuCon to be documented.</p>

<p>Believe me when I say I am one of the most appreciative persons of your work, @allereli.  I realize this post probably isn't the response you're looking for, but please take it in stride and reevaluate the situation based upon what's stated above.</p></div></article><article id="post-7424" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, November 10th, 2017, 12:25:22 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@estild said in <a href="/post/7423">Official: Simucon Indiegogo Giftbags Available Now</a>:</p>

<p>you need to put yourself in my position. if you saw people who couldn't put in 15 minutes of work a week on official documentation chatting away on Discord, how would you feel?  How fucking asinine does life have to be that we need to go repeat the same questions on the officials to get the information disseminated properly? I'm not saying don't contribute on Discord, but if you can be there, why can't you help out on official documentation a bit more?</p>
