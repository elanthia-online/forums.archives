The thing to note about these is that they're just glorified web browsers (Electron apps) that have separate pages for each platform you connect.  It's not much different than just using your own browser with a tab open for each platform.   Due to that, I didn't see much benefit in them.  They actually require more resources to run vs. just running them in your normal browser since running an Electron app is forcing your system to load up a duplicate browser rendering engine.  That's not to say they're 100% the same, as Electron apps do allow for some different features (like Push To Talk with Discord, which you can't do from a webpage alone), but 99% of the time, I don't need those missing features from an actual web browser.  I just access Slack and Discord from normal browser tabs.</p></div></article><article id="post-6008" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 4:48:02 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli said in <a href="/post/6005">Aggregate chat clients</a>:</p>

<p>Well right, you mentioned a lifetime license for Trillian.  I never purchased Pro, so I'm sure it's a better user experience.  I never found Trillian good enough to do that.  Been using Pidgin since 2005 or 2006.  </p>
