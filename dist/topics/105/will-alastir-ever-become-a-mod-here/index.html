<p>I am not a mod, so I'll start with that.  I have no issues, nor do I bear any ill will to either you (I have nfc who you are anyway) or Alastir.</p>

<p>I find it EXTREMELY UNLIKELY (as in .001% chance) that he will become a mod of these forums based on two things: 1. The prior history of moderation on the PC and 2. His current antagonistic approach to certain pro-PC registrants who have no desire or interest to come to these boards.  You'd likely have better luck winning the PowerBall at this rate than Alastir has of becoming a mod.</p>

<p>I would say you could rest easy, but I doubt you will until @Whirlin confirms beyond a shadow of doubt.</p></div></article><article id="post-808" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 9:17:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@maetriks I assume that as well, but you know what happens when you assume.</p></div></article><article id="post-809" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 9:18:56 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage said in <a href="/post/806">Will Alastir ever become a mod here?</a>:</p>

<p>I have to point out that your username is <em>sabotage</em>, by the way.</p>

<p>But relax. You're fine.

<p>I have not endorsed anyone for anything.  I'm just willing to leave things behind from that other forum and give people a fresh start here.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
