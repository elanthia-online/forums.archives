<p>First big goal achieved. Now to finish up CM from 70 ranks.
By my calculations, a bit under 2m XP after that to achieve the huge goal of 3x spell research, once CM is done.</p>

<p>Also, still kinda shocked that I haven't slowed down yet. I get the feeling that the SR slog will do it, though.</p></div></article><article id="post-1914" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Leafiara</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 7:03:29 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>My empath hit 303 Physical Fitness yesterday!

<p>I jotted down a list of things I could do with 192 PTPs instead of getting +1 cleric CS, died a little inside when suddenly 14.77 ranks of Stalking &amp; Hiding looked kinda appealing just so I could mess around in TSC, and decided I'd be fine with Leafiara getting to 488 CS (159/40/40 spells) and staying there forever!</p>

<p>...but after some more thought I figured I'll train cheap things like 2x First Aid and 2x Survival that are quick enough to feel a sense of progress, even if I don't get much tangible benefit, and then fixskill out much later to push CS all in one go.</p></div></article><article id="post-1915" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 7:09:28 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@leafiara </p>

<p>My MO is to get little victories, then when I'm in for a long slog I untrain those little ones to throw into the big one, then repeat. It makes me feel more productive though I realize that's a lie.</p></div></article><article id="post-1924" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 7:45:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ososis </p>

<p>I might do that once I hit 500 CS unboosted. For some reason, that particular number holds a lot of weight with me.
Plus, my plan of going 1/1/1 in all 3 circles to finish things up means I'll be getting tangible CS benefits regularly in the 100's and 200's.</p>

<p>Still, I'll probably be taking a break at 500 CS to, say, finish 1x survival, or get spirit lore up to the next 116 range cutoff.</p></div></article><article id="post-1944" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 12:01:22 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Someday I'll finish 3x spells.....Maybe by the time Gemstone V rolls out.</p></div></article><article id="post-2410" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Leafiara</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 19th, 2017, 5:56:09 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Edged Weapons......................|     201     101</p>

<p>How much is the EG generator? 25k pops into my head but lots of wrong things do that. May be worthwhile to buy BS with silvers is my thought.</p></div></article><article id="post-3367" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">horibu</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 9:07:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>It was 25k last run. It's 5 BS per pull here. At 1500 silvers per BS rate, that's 7500 silvers per pull compared to EG's 25k.

<p>1 Booklet = 50 Runs * 250 Scrip Per Run = 12,500 Scrip / 5 Per Ore = 2500 Chances * 25,000 EG Price = 62,500,000 Silvers.</p>

<p>62,500,000 Silvers / 12,500 Scrip = 5000.  as long as you buy scrip at no mor ethan 5,000 Silvers per, it's better to use scrip.</p>

<p>Edit:  Yes, I COULD just use 1 trade on the 25,000, but it's more fun to calculate out an entire booklet.</p></div></article><article id="post-3392" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Leafiara</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 26th, 2017, 6:22:55 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Hmm, okay then, I'll give it a go when Duskruin's wrapping up!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
