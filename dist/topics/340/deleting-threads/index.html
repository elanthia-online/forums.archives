<p>I like it.  Most of us are adults here.  I'm sure as with anything, if it starts to become an issue and is abused the situation can be addressed.</p></div></article><article id="post-3336" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Parkbandit</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 4:12:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir said in <a href="/post/3335">Deleting threads</a>:</p>

<p>I enjoy your glass half full type approach.  I'm like that.. but I've also seen it abused on other forums.  Just because you start the thread shouldn't give you the power to abruptly end the thread whenever you desire.</p>

<p>For an admin, obviously there are reasons to have that ability.  I just don't believe the random user should have that capability.</p></div></article><article id="post-3337" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 4:14:07 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@parkbandit said in <a href="/post/3336">Deleting threads</a>:</p>

<p>These aren't other forums and shouldn't be judged on what people choose to do on other forums.

<p>Oh, I agree.  I've seen many things abused on different forums.  Some people abuse the reputation system and all sorts of things.</p></div></article><article id="post-3363" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Parkbandit</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 8:35:23 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir said in <a href="/post/3342">Deleting threads</a>:</p>
