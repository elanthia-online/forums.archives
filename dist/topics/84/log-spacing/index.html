<p>[Circle of Trees, Entry]
The pathway to this secluded circle of trees is flanked by low burning torches set into the ground.  Encroaching on either side, the edge of the jungle creates a green tunnel through which only the barest glimpse of the vegetation beyond can be seen.  The ring of trees stretches to the east and west, and a bright glow beckons from the clearing in the center.  Nearby, a tall teak tree with a massively thick trunk looms overhead and a trail of evenly spaced grooves leads up into its height.
Obvious paths: east, west
