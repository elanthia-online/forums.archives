<p><strong>1. some thick vultite full plate</strong></p>

<p>4x, temp ecp, perm moderate crush resistance</p>

<p>2.5m flat</p>

<p>```
As you sing, you feel a faint resonating vibration from the vultite full plate in your hand...</p>

<p>It has a bonus of +20 from a normal plate, and the way it vibrates in tune with your voice tells you that it is plate armor.  It also has some type of special ability, but you can't tell what yet.    The vultite full plate seems to have some sort of unusual protection against damage.</p>

<p>The harmonics generated tell you that the plate serves to reduce the severity of inflicted wounds.
The plate resonates with your voice, revealing some details of its temporary enhancement:
    The plate's enhancement will degrade when the wearer is struck in combat.
    It should be able to withstand an incredible amount of uses before its enhancement has completely degraded away.
    When its enhancement has degraded away, the item will lose its special ability.</p>

<p>As your song penetrates the vultite full plate, you determine that it is moderately resistant to crushing attacks.</p>

<p>Roblar whispers, "Temp ecp."
