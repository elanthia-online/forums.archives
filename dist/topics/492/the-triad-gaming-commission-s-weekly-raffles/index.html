100 total tickets will be sold for 10,000 silvers each. There is no limit to the number of tickets an individual can purchase. Each ticket will have a number from 1-100 on them. Each ticket sold will be in sequential order as available. If you buy a block of 10, you will have the next ten numbers available in sequential order.</p>

<p>Payments must be made to Ordim in game who will provide your numbers to you and document their purchase. As soon as one of two conditions occurs the raffle will be drawn -
All 100 tickets are sold, the raffle drawing will be announced and scheduled for the next 9pm eastern time available.
A week from the start of the raffle, ending at 9pm on the day of the start. (If the first sells out by Sunday, and a new one starts, that raffle will pull when all tickets are sold, or at 9pm of the following Sunday)</p>

<p>Raffle draws will be conducted by a public third-party service. Names of those who bought tickets will not be revealed and it will only draw and present the winning number. That number will be cross-referenced with the Commissions records and the winner contacted and the payout delivered. The "drawing" will be publicly held in Solhaven North Market (room 1438) and the results URL posted here and given to the group currently presented. There will be a "ceremony" inside the game.</p>

<p>Payouts will be 80% to the winner and 20% kept by the commission to be used for funds for future gaming options and hopefully the official MHO endowment if/when the group is confirmed. There will be more official IC postings related to the MHO group in the future including what we hope to be a popular event for most shortly after the group is made official. </p>

<p>TL:DR - 
The Jester's Gambit raffle</p>

<p>if you were doing 1-100, why not use the wheel IG?</p></div></article><article id="post-5203" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, September 17th, 2017, 9:19:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I wasn't aware of it/didn't think of it.</p>

<p>The third raffle will most likely have a different format: Up to 100 unique people can buy up to 1000 tickets each based on the restrictions on weighting entries and the number of entries there can be per raffle. 
I can also switch to names instead of numbers if people would be interested in that instead.</p></div></article><article id="post-5228" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 18th, 2017, 7:11:02 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>74 tickets left from the second raffle!</p></div></article><article id="post-5249" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 19th, 2017, 7:53:55 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>68!</p></div></article><article id="post-5277" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 20th, 2017, 6:57:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>62!</p></div></article><article id="post-5301" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 9:57:01 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>41 tickets left!</p></div></article><article id="post-5312" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 3:49:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>21!</p></div></article><article id="post-5319" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 7:14:40 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>All tickets sold for the 2nd raffle!
