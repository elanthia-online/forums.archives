That being said, I'd like some sort of ability to give someone a virtual thumbs up for a particularly clever post.  I've seen on Discord (which I'm barely conversant with) the ability to 'like' a line, or add an emoji to it, which people who come after can see.  Is that a functionality that can be implemented here?</p>

<p>I realize Upvoting is a thing here, but I don't necessarily want to Upvote something if it is going to make things go out of chronological order.  Is that what would happen?  Maybe I'm just too much of a newb to this whole interwebs "thing" to understand how it all works....</p></div></article><article id="post-266" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 8:16:51 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>At the top right of a post is an up arrow and a number.

<p>Which appears to NOT mess up chronological order, which was my fear.  Excellent.  File this all under "0zy is a moron" and move on.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
