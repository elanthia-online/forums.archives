<p>Okay, I've spent some time today working on a way to exchange your item (the large-eyed purple dove charm) if you're unhappy with it. These changes will be live shortly (within the next hour or so).</p>

<p>You have two options. </p>

<p>You can TOSS the charm and get a hawk charm instead. It will be a crested hawk charm. It is the same scripted item, but it has some message variations for the hawk setting. Hawks whistle/chirp instead of coo and swoop instead of flutter or flap. It's not much different, but it's a different style of bird that I don't believe was offered at all yet.</p>

<p>You can BREAK the charm for a 4x RPA orb (a shimmering violet orb). These work just like the others, and they are not attuned.</p>

<p>Both choices are permanent once you make them, so be sure you are 100% positive you'd like to do this.</p>

<p>We apologize for all the mishaps during the creation, delivery, and missteps for this year's Goodie Bag. We've learned a lot from it.</p>

<p>Wyrom, PM</p>
