So much so, I dragged Elysia into a run after having read Whirlin's "How to Reim" as well as whatever other info I could find, but the results weren't pretty.  Essentially here's a paraphrased transcript:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Oh hey, a commoner..."</li>
<li>"Woah.. here come some more... "</li>
<li>"Ow!  Holy crap how did that guy knock me over?"</li>
<li>"Uh.. now there are like 10 of them!?"</li>
<li>"Ow... OW! CRAP!  That guy just head-butted me! TWICE!"  </li>
<li>(runs a few rooms east)</li>
<li>(runs back, realizing he'd left Elysia prone, stunned, and in roundtime)</li>
<li>(drag Elysia, E, E)</li>
<li>"Ok, let's see...."</li>
<li>"Aww hell, here come more..."</li>
<li>"Uh.. I can't fire my bow cuz headwound...."</li>
<li>"How do we get OUUUUT of here??"</li>
<li>(E,E,E go voidportalthingie)</li>
<li><pant, pant, pant> "WTF!??" (Elysia yelling that to me...)</li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah.. that happened.  We left our 2hr timer at 1:50 remaining and didn't go back.  And here I thought we'd do fine as a Ranger/Bard combo (we are both 60).  Is there any other source of information I could look up?  Creature lists that might include attack type?  Strategies per class?  If the advice is, "Just forget about it til you're 80+" I am totally down with that too. :)</p></div></article><article id="post-1747" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ragz</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 2:51:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@erek it sounds like you may have just had some bad luck. If you suddenly realized there were 10 creatures in the room you probably experienced an "invasion" - those will happen once every couple hours and will spawn several creatures per person. Normal waves are every ~45 sec and will spawn 0-1 per person. </p>

<p>Sometimes you'll get maneuvers thrown at you when the normal creatures spawn, but you will frequently get maneuvers thrown at you when a rare is spawned. If they disable you there's no shame in retreating to the vortex and getting healing before jumping back in. </p>

<p>Again, it sounds like probably just lucked out with an invasion right close to when you entered. Try again! :)</p>

<p>Good luck</p></div></article><article id="post-1748" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 2:52:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>They're non-corporeal bandits, basically.

If there were other people in your level range running reim then that could be why you such a large spawn.  I've found that solo reim is fairly boring where as a duo has enough action to keep it interesting yet still allowing you to explore and read the room descriptions.</p>

<p>Beyond that always carry rosemarrow potion as headbutt is to be expected often.  You'll catch on quickly which profession goes by which name though in each region of the map you'll have to re-learn it.   </p>

<p>Whichever one of you is the bard really will make the run a success. Incant 1002 Vibe chant at everything and then pick off the creatures at your leisure.</p>

<p>1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91+</p>

<p>The level ranges always confused me, too, why would I take my level 62 bardess to hunt where there were level 90 critters? That's a laughable situation in GS normally. Which was one reason I have hardly done any trips to Reim at all.</p>

<p>But I think I have come to understand that people group in tighter ranges and the auto-critter-leveler-thing would usually keep the foes more or less up to the highest level in your group.</p>

<p>I think.  I mean, Mister @Ordim always specifies a group range much smaller than 61-90. A couple others have, too.</p>

<p>Gap nothin'. You run Reim with a good group once a day for a month, you're uncountable for life. I haven't killed an undead in 30 levels and I'm still uncountable.</p></div></article><article id="post-2016" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 3:16:11 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@luxelle said in <a href="/post/1996">Help an &quot;old noob&quot; learn and understand Reim?</a>:</p>

<p>individual ghosts spawn at a level range for the person they spawn for. For example: Let's say you have a level 35, a 40, and a 46 in a group in Reim. Three ghosts spawn, part of the spawn says "and rushes at" or something similar, that indicates who caused what to spawn. The ghost will be within ~3 levels of the person it spawned for. So with this group, there is a very good chance that the level 35 will spawn ghosts that don't count for credit (over 10 levels under the 46) for script or credit for rares. But otherwise, that's the only level ranges of ghosts, they won't get any level 60's unless a level 60 is in there and moving around with them. Ghosts spawned by others have a very low chance of attacking if not attacked first, to prevent left overs from higher level groups hurting other people of lower level.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I will run another group, I'm level 80 which would put my group range around 75-85 give or take, depending, but the interest level has dropped to the point that I'm not particularly interested in Reim anymore.</p></div></article><article id="post-2024" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Luxelle</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 4:08:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You've almost caught up to me!

<p>Yes, get the caster first.</p></div></article><article id="post-2070" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ragz</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 17th, 2017, 8:12:54 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ponclast the strategy will depend on your class a little, and how fast you can kill them. Caster first usually works out pretty good. If you're a wizard, weapon fire goes a long way against them. Water-heavy wizards can 512 them a couple of times to make the emperor a bit less dangerous followed with a few channeled 510s for a tidy cleanup. Acid and steam both work pretty good otherwise, along with 917</p></div></article></div></body></html>
