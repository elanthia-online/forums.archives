<p>Also, if memory serves, the original theme showed the chat option more prominently on the user profile. Now I need to click on the hamburger button to see the option, which is fine, but I'm not sure that a new user would even realize the chat is even an option with the current/new UI.</p></div></article><article id="post-1864" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 2:01:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>i agree it's less friendly, but you can click on the chat icons at the bottom right corner and they will open/close</p></div></article><article id="post-1868" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 2:08:11 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ondreian said in <a href="/post/1864">Chat window won&apos;t go away / less-friendly in general</a>:</p>

<p>Doesn't seem to be any way to get rid of it on (iOS) mobile, though.</p></div></article><article id="post-1870" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 2:15:43 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'll have to see if I can borrow a cellphone to test or play on Browserstack.
