<p>It's been .... 18 years? But I'm back. And I have a locker and person full of stuff that I'd love to trace the lineage of (as I don't remember some of it). I participated in the spitfire and juggernauts of old. </p>

<p>Anyone able to help ID things and tell me their origin and what they do, I'd be obliged. I have a bunch of trinkets and edible stuff that I'm not even sure what they do!</p>

<p>Also - forgive me if some of this is generic but it's been quite a long time so I'm not sure!</p>

<p><strong>On My Person</strong>
* shadowy black leather tool pouch
* some supple black leather gloves
* a long black leather cloak
* a crystal sphere cloak clasp
* a onyx-inlaid black leather thigh-sheath
* a supple black leather backpack
* a sturdy dark leather gem pouch
* some padded black leather boots
* an eahnor elven infantry wall shield.
* a wickedly curved faenor waraxe (I believe from the juggernaut - 12 points weighting and crit weighted I think)
* spotted black toy warrior
* a fuzzy green toy sylvan
* a small silver mirror
* a modwir piccolo</p>

<p><strong>In My Locker</strong>
* a mithril juggernaut pin (clearly from the juggernaut)
* a tiger-claw
* a table leg
* some smokey grey leathers
* a pure potion
* a diamond and vultite wedding ring
* a diamond and vultite wedding band
* a small Silvergate pin
* a massive glaes club
* a gargantuan granite-studded club
* a huge granite club
* a soapstone amulet
* a shiny blue glaes orb
* a polished pewter pinky ring
* a black short sword
* a jet black scarf
* a brisk peppermint sachet
* a mithril alloy mesh kilt
* some fitted black leather breeks
* some cherry menthol lozenges
* some cherry menthol lozenges
* a bottle of creamy ivory elixir</p></div></article><article id="post-7060" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 30th, 2017, 7:35:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>try searching the wiki for it</p></div></article><article id="post-7094" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, October 31st, 2017, 10:07:11 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Pure Potion - Bravery/uncurses a cursed item.
Most of what you have there does seem pretty generic, the sachet might be scripted so it smells nicely. You might want to have a bard sing to those smoky grey leathers.</p>

<p>Looks like the boots, thigh-sheath and pouch are from the Landing rogue guild.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
