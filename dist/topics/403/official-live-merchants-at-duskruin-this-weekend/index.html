<p>Starting tomorrow, we'll have some live action merchant work at Duskruin as a bonus offer this run to make up for some of the delays. This will include some services like general alterations, features, tattoos, and possibly some other services in line with what you'd find at a wandering merchant. Services will be very low cost in bloodscrip (between 100 to 500). Since the area will be open over the weekend and through Labor Day, you'll have several opportunities to gain some work!</p>

<p>Wyrom, PM</p></div></article><article id="post-4020" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 12:21:18 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Note this starts tomorrow, but runs through the weekend.</p></div></article><article id="post-4021" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 12:22:28 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Now that's the kind of low cost stuff I wanted to see as a thanks.

I am curious why they have not sold light/deep certs directly for BS though, that would seem like the natural progression after making the certs for Delirium Manor. 
Just a simple +200lbs epic deep cert for 6k BS. Or something along those lines, to free up having to do them manually.</p></div></article><article id="post-4054" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 10:47:23 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Mogonis, weapons or jewelry?</p>

<p>For example, I go to a merchant doing, oh, I don't know, lesser black ora jewelry unlocks.  If I get spun, I have the opportunity to get a locked version of said item (and it can't be unlocked at that session).</p>

<p>And maybe not every time, or for every 'thing', but if this was an option the majority of the time unlocking was offered, that'd be fantastic.</p></div></article><article id="post-4057" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 10:53:06 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@0zymandius, makes sense.

<p>For the jewelry, it just has to be one of the lesser ones (permanently worn type).  It doesn't change the worn location, just gives it the other functions.</p>

<p>Those are the only two games they are coded with.  I've thought about making some new games.</p></div></article><article id="post-4065" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 11:28:27 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>A poker game would be AMAZING.</p></div></article><article id="post-4066" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 11:29:23 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Single deck poker games might be possible, but more as a standalone item.

<p>I've been trying to get a "real" poker deck for some time.  I could make it using paper, if there was only a way to get a random thing from a container.  Asking for a rummage syntax to get a random item has been something a number of people have said would be great.</p></div></article><article id="post-4091" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 8:25:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@wyrom said in <a href="/post/4059">Official: Live Merchants at Duskruin This Weekend</a>:</p>
