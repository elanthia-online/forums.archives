<p>Entirely up to you.

(Otherwise you need to go up a bonding level before they show up)    And 1602/1615 are the ony two spells you can infuse.  Honestly, I never use that ability.</p></div></article><article id="post-574" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Erek</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 11:58:52 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What about the other 1623 questions?</p>

I think I understand 1625 but am hoping to be wrong. I have a lvl 33 pally with up to 1631 and the only lore I have is 6 ranks of Religion. I can't infuse 1604 into my lvl 3 bonded Spikestar and am only getting regular 1625 flares. I want the double flares but don't think I'll do too much with Beseech/infusion. </p>

<p>How do I get the double flares? 40 ranks of Spiritual Lore Summoning?</p></div></article><article id="post-7196" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Cwolff</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, November 3rd, 2017, 10:16:50 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Woa....wait a second. After sending the above message I finally noticed this IG. So I guess I have the double flares now. Is it because I cast 1604 on my spikestar?</p>

<p>You swing a perfect mithril spikestar at a scaly burgee!
  AS: +314 vs DS: +153 with AvD: +31 + d100 roll: +53 = +245
   ... and hit for 58 points of damage!
   Impressive shot shatters wrist!
   The scaly burgee is stunned!</p>

<p><em>* Your mithril spikestar pulses with a burst of plasma energy! *</em></p>

<p>... 25 points of damage!
   Dazzling arc of energy traces blackened path across the scaly burgee's chest!</p>

<p><em>* Your mithril spikestar sprays with a burst of plasma energy! *</em></p>

<p>... 25 points of damage!
   Searing blast of energy to hip spins the scaly burgee around!

Spirit lore blessings is what you want for secondary flare frequency:</p>

<p>The base chance for a second flare increases by 4% per seed 3 summation, from an additional 4% chance at 3 ranks to a maximum bonus of 68% at 187 ranks</p>

<p>40 Summoning so I can port my body to the beginning of OTF if I die.
30 Religion for the 15% reduction to DS against mobs.
40 Blessing for the +5 to Guard the Meek.</p>
