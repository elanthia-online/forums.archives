<p>Notes on Piercing!</p>

<p>Now, not every piercing jewelry can be worn in any area. Earrings.. earbobS(plural).. things like that, can be worn in both ears.. single items, such as a hoop can be worn in one or the other, generally. Possible locations for many, but not all jewelry include: right eyebrow, left eyebrow, both eyebrows, nose, right nostril, left nostril, lip, left ear, right ear, both ears.</p>

<p>Piercing jewelry and you! How to keep it clean and healthy. You'll want some form of incredibly potent and tasty alcohol, generally whiskey.. or you can also get a tincture of acantha. Those are generally available on the bench in TSC. Pour the liquid on the piercing. You'll want to do this right after getting it pierced and regularly for a few days afterwards. Personally, I recommend every few hours for three days, but others might recommend alternative amounts. Tinctures of acantha also wont leave you stunned and helpless after use, but whiskey means you can get drunk on the extra. Your choice!</p>

<p><strong>Scarification Services:</strong> https://gswiki.play.net/mediawiki/in...Scarring_razor   - currently being done by an alt d/t first aid ranks needed.</p>

<p>Scarification and You!</p>

<p>Using a scarring razor you can have your distinguishing mark feature spot replaced with something else (ALTER 34 to see what that one is).</p>

<p>Using a scarring razor you can select the noun of the mark, a descriptor of the mark, where the mark will be and preposition used for the location.</p>

<p>For example I can make a jagged(descriptor) birthmark(noun) across(preposition) the right cheek(location)</p>

<p>Options - </p>

<p>Noun:
birthmark, blemish, disfigurement, lump, mark, marking, mole, patch, pock, pockmark, wart, scar, or brand </p>

<p>Descriptor:
angular, asymmetrical, barbed, blackened, bumpy, craggy, crooked, dark, darkened, discolored, flat, forked, indented, irregular, jagged, lopsided, narrow, notched, patchy, pitted, raised, ridged, rough, rugged, slanted, straight, uneven, zigzagged, A-shaped, B-shaped (all the way through to Z-shaped)</p>

<p>Location:
right cheek, left cheek, nose, upper lip, lower lip, chin jawbone, jawline, neck, neckline, collarbone, forehead, right eyebrow, left eyebrow, right eye, left eye, right ear, left ear.</p>

<p>Preposition:
above, across, along, around, below, by, near, on, over, toward, under, underneath</p>

<p><strong>Jewelry Creation Services:</strong> https://gswiki.play.net/mediawiki/in...lry<em>box#Tier</em>5</p>

<p>Daxela's Jewelry Box - Creating Custom Zested Jewelry - I've got a t6 box(fully unlocked and all sides of it also have a custom option.)</p>

<p>You can insert a gem or a skin into the box and you will make a (adjective) (gem/skin description) (jewelry noun). For example I can put an uncut diamond into it, select ring worn, select the signet setting, and the gaudy adjective and make "a gaudy uncut diamond signet"</p>

<p>The jewelry made is also zested for PUSH and TURN.</p>

<p>Jewelry Type: Head, neck, wrist, ankle, finger, pin, ears</p>

<p>Custom Settings - My box has these, normal boxes do not. Anyone can get theirs customized with the right merchant.</p>

<p>Your current custom pendant setting is a fox-shaped.
Your current custom bracelet setting is a complex.
Your current custom anklet setting is a charm-laden.
Your current custom diadem setting is a primitive.
Your current custom ring setting is a segmented.
Your current custom earrings setting is some chandelier.
Your current custom pin setting is a silver-haloed.</p>

<p><strong>Embellishing Services:</strong></p>

<p>Alteration Wand Services!</p>

<p>I have now an item that allows you to "alter" your items. I am still exploring the limitations, but so far here is what we know:</p>

<p>Insert a gem into the wand to power it.</p>

<p>You can wave the wand at ANYTHING that can be interacted with, excluding fellow adventurers. Anything you can interact with in the environment, be it a doorway, an item, a creature, a window, an altar, etc should work with it. </p>

<p>The item must fit the 15/15/15 and not have a long or a show. Certain items do not work, as I've had mixed results on forged weapons(if it has the hilt removed it works?). Some items with a show due to the script do work, such as fusion and cidolfhus bandoliers(tested each so far)</p>

<p>You hold the item you want to alter in your left hand, the wand in your right hand, and WAVE the wand at the thing you want to add to the description. The wand does NOT work on people, but anything else you can interact with works, so far.</p>

<p>Examples:
a small white marble shrine engraved with the Japhrimel coffin design
a wide sharply pointed choker etched with a petrified slave hand design
a deep ebony vest embellished with a skeletal corpse of a satyr design</p></div></article><article id="post-2093" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Shad0ws0ngs</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 17th, 2017, 12:45:17 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Well, that didn't turn out quite how I wanted.
