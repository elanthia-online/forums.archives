  <p>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — Police in Connecticut say a man was critically injured when he was pinned between a car and a tree as he was giving his 11-year-old daughter a driving lesson. </p>
  
  <p>New Haven police say the 25-year-old man jumped out of the car and tried to stop it as it reversed toward a house on Wednesday. The car crashed through a fence and struck a gas line before pinning him.</p>
  
  <p>The man was taken to a hospital in critical condition. The girl was not injured.
  Several nearby homes were evacuated as crews tried to stop the gas leak.</p>

  <p>Q: My Mom Poisoned My Girlfriend
  My girlfriend "Cleo" is allergic to seafood but does not carry an epi-pen because “It’s not that type of reaction,” but she always asks lots of questions about the ingredients and how the food is cooked. My mom always finds the questions insulting and believed Cleo was making up the allergy since she doesn’t carry the epi-pen. This past Labor Day at my family BBQ, Cleo did her usual questioning before eating. Maybe 30 minutes later she started complaining that her face itched. She took Benedryl but she turned red, and her eyes began swelling. We had to go to the ER for a cortisone shot. As we’re getting in the car, my mom confessed she fried the fish and chicken in the same oil and lied when Cleo asked. She admitted she planned to prove Cleo’s allergy was fake. My mom apologized and is paying the ER bill. Even so, Cleo called my mom a monster and wants nothing to do with her. She also broke up with me because I shouldn’t have to choose between her and mom. She won’t consider a compromise like eating before visits. Is there anyway to get passed my anger at my mom and get Cleo back?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Senator Rob Portman has introduced a bill to congress that would be detrimental to Sex Workers, small businesses, and tech giants alike. The Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act or SESTA, S. 1963, however cleverly titled, is not at all what it claims to be. It boasts of being the answer to uncovering and punishing those engaged in sex trafficking online but what it actually is about is internet censorship. It is an attempt to remove the protection websites are currently offered under Section 230 of The Communications Decency Act. Section 230 is in place to uphold freedom of expression on the internet and protects websites from being liable for what a third party might post outside of their knowledge. If this bill passes, any person or business online could be subject to civil or state penalties if the authorities “believe” there is any trafficking or condoning of trafficking on your site. How is that determined? What activities will they consider illegal online? What about consenting adults engaging in sexual online courtship? What about our favorite fetish and cruising sites? What about individuals who enjoy posting nude or nude implied photos of themselves online? Would we then have to be worried about our naked photos being considered illegal solicitation?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The day of the procedure, purple ink oozed out of her eye and trickled down her cheek. The next day, the eye was swollen shut, and eventually became painfully infected. Three weeks later, the internal swelling remained and doctors told her she was at risk of going permanently blind in the affected eye.</p>
  
  <p>She already has about 25 tattoos on her body, and has undergone another risky procedure to split her tongue to make it appear forked. So Gallinger said getting a sclera tattoo seemed like the next step. . . . But Gallinger hadn’t done enough research and gave in too soon to pressure from her boyfriend, she said.</p>
  
  <p>During the procedure, Gallinger said he made many errors. He did not mix the ink with any saline. He used a large needle instead of a small one, which went too deep into the eye. And instead of doing several small dosages, Gallinger just took one large injection during a 10-minute sitting.</p>
