They get special gifts and bragging rights. It's also a fun way to get to know the people you hang out with on a daily basis in the world of Elanthia. The Frost King and Frost Queen will get to ride a float in our Winterfest Parade. As in years past, they will also get a crown/diadem and a scepter that do more than just make good decorations on yourself.</p>
