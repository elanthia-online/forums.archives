```
It has a bonus of +9 from a normal runestaff, and the way it vibrates in tune with your voice tells you that it requires skill in twohanded weapons to use effectively.</p>

<p>The runestaff resonates with your voice, indicating that it enhances its owner in the following ways:
    It provides a bonus of 6 to Sorcerous Lore - Demonology Bonus.
    This enhancement may not be used by adventurers who have not trained 21 times.
    It provides a bonus of 7 to Logic Bonus.
    This enhancement may not be used by adventurers who have not trained 39 times.
    It provides a bonus of 4 to Perception Bonus.
    This enhancement may not be used by adventurers who have not trained 4 times.
    The runestaff looks to have a lot of charges remaining.</p>

<p>You sense that the deringo runestaff will persist after its last enhancive charge has been expended.

<strong>CB 2m Kivet SOLD</strong></p>

<p>This auction will not be cross-posted on other forums. However, due to the newness of this board I will be taking bids on the LNET merchant channel and via pretty much any other communication method and will be calling at a slower rate than I have done in the past until I get bored. Any private bids better have a good reason.</p></div></article><article id="post-3190" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kivet</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 1:24:56 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If this is still available I'll take it, would message you, but it won't let me since you got it restricted.</p></div></article><article id="post-3194" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 1:56:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>yes it is still available.
