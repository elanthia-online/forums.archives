<p>Deep Sea Diving </p>

<p>Upon entry to the Abandoned Waters, (and with the appropriate diver's license from the SimuCoin store) you will be suited with a gnomish air helmet. This helmet will last for 30 minutes. During that time, you have up to 10 searches within the sea. This number is based on where you are searching. If you are searching in the shallow waters (we'll call this level 1), then you have 10 searches. If you are searching in deeper waters (we'll call these levels 2, 3, and 4) then you have 5 searches.</p>

<p>On Level 1, there are no obstacles. On Levels 2 and 3, there are obstacles that you will need to counter. (IE: jellyfish, squid, etc.) These obstacles can be countered by using an appropriate item (harpoons, bellows, and fishing nets); these items can be found while playing any game - digging, mini-games, Deep Sea Diving, and fishing.</p>

<p>Levels 2 and 3 provide an initial bonus, but in order to maintain or improve that bonus, you must appropriately counter those obstacles. Failure to do so will drop this bonus slightly, though it will never drop to zero. You can LOOK at any obstacle (or counter item) to get information about it. You have a limited amount of time to initiate a counter.</p>

<p>Level 4 (which is a Premium only area) provides a bonus without obstacles. In addition, there are seashell caches to be found in this area. There are no caches on Levels 1, 2 or 3.</p>

<p>You need to keep your body moving while you're in the deeper areas of the sea. The bends are unpleasant and will result in scrambling back to the shallower waters, which will also remove any bonus you may have accumulated.</p>

<p>Items needed for the 2017 Quest can be found exclusively in Deep Sea Diving.</p>

<p>2017 Quest </p>

<p>The 2017 quest is a progressive quest that will require participation from many players.</p>

<p>The quest is broken into 4 phases and is currently on Phase 1. In order to move the quest to Phase 4, players will need to participate! Once everything opens up on Friday (10/6), the "how" should become apparent. Some may have already figured this out based on NPC responses. There is an individual cap on participation, but continued participation beyond that cap still progresses the quest as a whole. Quest components will drop in Deep Sea Diving and can be traded/sold to other players.</p>

<p>Sometime after the quest reaches Phase 4, a reward item will become available to all players. This item does not require a Pass (Games, Services &amp; Raffles, or Shopping) to obtain, but it will attune to your character. In addition, it carries a silvers cost of 250k. In its base form, it is a zesty item that anyone can use. For participants who are at the individual cap for the quest, it will provide some mechanical benefits that will progress over the next 5 years based on quest participation in this and subsequent years, similarly to the Heart item from the Necropolis at previous Ebon Gate events. And finally, for those who choose to convert to the new deity, there is a third mechanical benefit.</p>

<p>Note that in order to access the Tier 3 benefit, you must be converted to Ghezresh AND you must have participated to the full extent in that year's quest.</p>

<p>Fishing </p>

<p>It will cost 50 seashells to enter the fishing area. Once inside, (make sure you take your fishing gear with you!), you will remain until you catch a fish. After a successful catch, you will be removed from the room. Caught fish will need to be CUT to receive your prize (and maybe a filet). Fishing will yield items that are not found in other games, but can produce both Unique and Jackpot items.</p>

<p>Fishing does not require any specific skill, though a bit of survival may help you cut out a filet. General knowledge of the fishing system will help, as fishing can be a bit time-consuming, especially when unfamiliar with this activity.</p>

<p>You will need a fishing pole, fishing line, and bait, all of which can be found in the Fishing Shack down on the pier in Caligos Isle, though you're not required to purchase items from this shop - ANY fishing pole/wire/bait will function the same.</p>

<p>Conversion to the new deity will require an item found in fishing. Those who do not want to convert will have an alternate path if this item is found. This item is also tradeable.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<p>Happy DFQing!</p>

<p>I completely didn't even mention the quest requiring SC to get the "extra" reward, but I guess you could make a parallel to "unlocking" the heart from last EG.  I don't like the way the game is heading further and further into random loot micro-transactions.   I hate that there is even a chance you could spend $1000 and literally just come away with junk.</p>

<p>This is why I don't mind DR.  You spend your money and you get a minimum return with a higher return based on your skill/character class.  You know what the possible rewards are before hand and can make educated decisions on what you want to do.  These other events are basically the "open a box for a random reward" you find in all the shitty mobile games.  It could be the best thing ever, but most likely its a thing you already have 50 million of.</p>

<p>I want more DR events and no more DM/diving/DR dig events.</p></div></article><article id="post-5756" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 4th, 2017, 7:37:07 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You didn't have to buy into Delerium manor to unlock the heart, it was part of the base EG ticket/experience.
Likewise, you didn't HAVE TO play games (or use the general ticket currency at all) to buy regular shop items from the vendors.
Sure, a lot of people WILL buy a games pass and earn seashells but making the main stores only sell in that currency is explicitly saying "Look, we are forcing people to buy passes, even though we gave everyone the illusion that you could pick and choose what you wanted to do, but we made some choices for you".</p></div></article><article id="post-5757" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 4th, 2017, 7:44:33 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>While I'm planning on buying all the passes and stuff... a few thoughts:</p>

<p>I imagine people may have stores of extra sea shells to sell for silver for those not wanting to get a games pass if the drop rate is as high as the general tickets, but I dunno. You can use seashells to do the fishing game, too.</p>

<p>To me, it doesn't matter if 1 person has to pay $1 to progess the quest at that point, its still a shit move any way you cut it.

<p>The quest isn't an individual quest like most are thinking.  I'm trying not to say too much on the subject, as I'm not the designer.  But there are ways to participate in the quest without ever diving.</p>

  <p>So to be clear, Simutronics has no issues with putting this item behind the process of collecting X amount more dollars from their player base participating in DSD when in previous years it was included in the base ticket price? </p>
  
  <p>Because that's exactly what this is the further erosion of what people get for their money. You didn't really give anyone the option to not buy a games pass, SOMEONE has to buy one to gather seashells to buy items, you didn't REALLY give anyone the option to avoid DSD, its now tied to unlocking the EG item.</p>
  
  <p>To me, it doesn't matter if 1 person has to pay $1 to progess the quest at that point, its still a shit move any way you cut it. Same thing with the seashells, its one thing to change up the currency to YET ANOTHER currency in the game, but to then only have shops that will take that currency just goes that much further down the road.</p>

<p>It's a pay event.  I'm still not following you.  Are you asking for seashells to be something outside of a pay event?</p>

<p>DSD is 100% optional.</p></div></article><article id="post-5781" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 4th, 2017, 1:51:02 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>A frankly, you've burned any "wait and see" on the previous stunts with the smithy.

<p>Ordim, take a breath.  In years prior, one had to shell out $50 to be able to join the quest for the hearts.  Someone may not have have even wanted to play games or go shopping last year, but still had to pay $50 just to complete hearts and what not. 
 This year, you don't have to buy ANY pass.  Yes, quest items will drop in Diving which costs 100 simucoins per entry, but players will also be able to trade/sell items to other players.  You yourself may be able to pay nothing but silvers in order to get max participation from the quest.</p></div></article><article id="post-5791" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 4th, 2017, 2:27:24 PM</div></div><div class="content"><blockquote>

<p>This is a bullshit line of reasoning and exactly what my contention is. NO ONE should have to buy into DSD for the EG component. The same thing with seashells, the primary shops with teased scripts shouldn't be locked behind someone buying seashells. </p>

<p>If people really don't have a problem with this then it's only going to get worse. This is exactly the stuff people were warning about months ago and now here it is. 
I'm sorry responding immediately on a forum and not bending the knee to the discord channel so I can have a near real time conversation is seen as so intense.

<p>That's not a defense or anything, I'm just stating we've never really teased pricing at all.  GM Haliste and I went through the entire shop list and tried to make sure there was enough inventory on both the seashell side and silver side.  I also know you're against alternative currencies beyond one or two.  So maybe it will help to understand why they are being used.</p>

<p>Since the inception of feeders, staff has to create a pile of items that they think will be enough incentive for players to participate or feel they are getting their money's worth.  Most times, we're spinning our wheels when we do this in the lower tiers.  Either because the items aren't very useful in a broad approach or because you're participation is at a higher level and you're finding dozens of the same items.  </p>

<p>What alternative currency allows us to do is shift prizes into a value and allow you to pick out the items you want, instead of having hundreds of an item you can't sell or do anything with.  We study the data from previous runs to know what the average times someone will play a game and try to formulate costs that work.</p>

<p>The reason silver doesn't work here is because it's not meant to skip the gaming part of "earning" it.  These items were intended to be the random prizes you won.  So it gets shifted into a different currency only because that's the term we use.  If we created a system where you could trade 5 of your feeder items for the next tier up, it is essentially the same thing.  Currency translates better to you.  It's instantly understood by the majority of players.  If we used digging from 2015 as an example, and we said, "You can trade 98 conch shells (T2 prize) for a loop of twisted leather (T3 prize)" that would be an extremely convoluted system.  Item management would be ridiculous and most people wouldn't understand.  Keep in mind there were 394 T2 prizes and 378 T3 prizes.  The charts we'd have to make for trade-ins would be absolutely bonkers.  But sometimes, I think if we did it this way, it would be more accepted than alternative currencies because your perception of it would be entirely different.</p>

<p>In some events, we tried to also solve a common concern where players spend cash to go to an event, but the event then requires millions of silvers to get anything worth it to them.  This is a core problem with an event like RtCF.  This is what birthed the original Duskruin's pricing model.</p>

<p>Feywrot Mire was more of a twisted carnival in a swamp.  So a prize wall was just a description of a shop we made with a lot of items.  Most those items were from the feeders.  We reviewed the feedback and data and found barely anything sold.  People wanted cooler/neater things.  Caligos Isle has just split the "prize wall" into themed shops.  The inventory you're seeing across a number of shops would have been the "prize wall" at Feywrot Mire.</p>

<p>This year, games will have a mix of prizes and seashells.  Again, using feedback from last year, going purely tickets as the prize was not as exciting for most players.  Even though they could then purchase the exact same prize from the prize wall that they would have found, players were more likely to hang onto all tickets for bigger prizes or the secondary market.  Now we're trying a mix.  </p>

<p>Lastly, event participation has grown quite a bit.  Outside Ebon Gate, having an event see participation counts into the multiple hundreds was not very likely.  GemStone IV saw around a 6% participation rate at the majority of our events.  Obviously things like RtCF and auctions sold out, but sustaining those sort of events were not something we could do.  We're now seeing about a 20% to 25% participation rate.  While there may be components to these events you dislike or loathe, it seems like we're finally hitting a formula that reaches a broader spectrum of our playerbase.  And it's not just about ROIs.  Yes, some of you participate because you can spend $100 and make $120, but someone is causing you to make that money.  Someone is buying in the secondary market as well as from the primary market.  So the demand is high across the board.</p></div></article><article id="post-5846" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 3:44:37 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@wyrom I understand the need for alternate currency.  The part I don't get is why every single event has to have its own currencies.  It makes it harder for the player base to keep track of their value.  I liked the prize wall idea, just the items seemed "meh".  I like big ticket items or services.  A lot of people have put a lot of time into their items so a new satchel with a new script isn't something I'm looking for.  My bag will probably never get made again by a GM again.  I loved that spell preps were on the prize wall, they just seemed to be the underwhelming ones.  I think you could have done well with the new bolt spell customizations offered at the last DR.  I would love to see this expanded into CM customizations for the squares but I'm getting off track.  I would bet that the biggest sellers were the pelt and gem bags or the spell preps for the prize wall.  I honestly couldn't even tell you what else was offered.</p>

<p>It would be much simpler to have 4 currencies.  Silver, DR scrip (it would be to hard to separate it out at this point), General Tickets (for games that play with silver), and Premium Tickets (from games that require SC).  You would be able to set their value and they could be used at multiple events.  I realize that this wouldn't be "in character" but not every aspect of everything has to IC.  I don't need a reason why this merchant would accept premium or general tickets from another event.  I paid money for them and want to be able to use them.  What should it matter if I spent money at DM and got tickets I never used but now there is an item at EG that I do want.  I spent the money either way.  Splitting it for every event leaves me wondering, am I ever going to be able to use these?  I know I asking myself about that regarding general tickets.</p></div></article><article id="post-5847" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 3:52:43 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Unfortunately, when we went down this road, we just didn't know the proper path.</p>

<p>Yeah honestly Wyrom I like the alt currency idea and all but there is absolutely no reason to have 50 alt currencies other than to confuse your customers. One alt currency , "general tickets" or whatever, for everything is fine. Plus, it feels like you're progressing when that single alt currency stacks up after each event. Rather than "Oh I got 2000 seashells, 1000 general tickets, 5000 bloodscrip, 9000 vellum scrips, 1000 doorknobs, 700 kitchen sinks, 10000 Cotton lint, 987 feral cats... omg what is this?!!"</p></div></article><article id="post-5850" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 8:10:37 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Whoa hey, everyone calm down, there's more than 3 posts in a 24 hour period on this board, must mean someone is INTENSE or MAD or needs to chill etc etc.</p></div></article><article id="post-5852" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">beldannon5</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 9:11:07 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I will be giving fishing lessons tonight.   5pm et on four winds isle.

<p>I like the idea of the shops being the new "prize wall" and the games just giving seashells so you can buy the prize you really want.</p>

<p>I do not like the idea of having a single alt-currency.  I think it would cause the prices of things, specifically the nice mechanical things to be blown out of proportion more than they already are.  When something costs 500000 bloodscrip because there are millions of bloodscrip in the system, that's a problem.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be against trading general tickets for seashells, but I would be against allowing any alt-currency to be transferred to bloodscrip for the reason above.</p></div></article><article id="post-5874" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 2:23:19 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir I was going to post earlier but I think what you just mentioned is exactly why they have to have alt currencies, because of the discrepancy with how much can be earned vs. the value of what can be bought with them.  If there was a single alt currency, then either the items at both EG and DR would have to be on the same level, OR the prices for items available would have to be essentially the same, neither of which is possible or even really desirable.  And while an exchange of currencies is certainly a good idea, I would imagine it's not a simple thing to implement given the issues I just mentioned.  </p>

<p>And while I see the reasoning behind the alt currencies, I'm wondering if long term it was wise to use seashells as I'm assuming at some point EG will leave Caligos Isle, unless that's not the case.  Not that you couldn't come up with another alt currency to replace seashells if it moved, but I think Simu would be doing themselves and us a favor if they just settled on BS as the DR or higher end alt currency and "X" as the lower tier EG or other similar low/mid tier event currency.  That way "X" could be applied to other events that may have items/gear on par with EG, unless they just plan on using seashells as that "X" currency for other similar events.</p></div></article><article id="post-5877" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 2:33:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You would just convert the seashells in a few years, if you didn't use them on items or services before the final run closed, to general tickets for Delirium Manor or future events.</p>

<p>I think there will at least be an exchange from other currencies to general tickets.  Then, you can convert when some shops like the one posted today offer the same item in multiple currencies.</p>

That's assuming that any other non DR/EG event they do between now and that change only uses silvers and not another alt currency.  Unless prior to said event they allowed the total conversion at 1:1 again.  So the low/mid tier alt currency is now seashells, but then in 2018 there's a "Cavern Spelunking" event in the Sea Caverns and they use "clams" as the alt currency and you can then do a total 1:1 conversion of however many seashells you have.</p></div></article><article id="post-5880" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 2:42:07 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>All of that being said, maybe Simu does need to let the populace know more or less what their long term plans are with alt currencies.</p></div></article><article id="post-5881" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 2:57:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>It would have been good to include in the teasers when something was restricted to seashells</p></div></article><article id="post-5882" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 3:01:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>A map going forward in general would be nice.

The problem you are addressing is that people are buying into a pay to win system but not receiving what they feel is an item or service that fits their needs, so they stock pile waiting for something that does, or sell off to others who do want a product or service. Combined with people moving away from silvers, blood scrip is in a position to become a currency that can more directly be converted to mechanical gains than silvers are. </p>

<p>What further increases the production of bloodscrip is the lack of post cap hunting options. This makes the arena a prized choice for many to grind exp etc because it allows them to pay to hunt things, filling their exp, rewarding them with a treasure they feel is worthwhile (blood scrip and random item(s)) and is easy to get to with zero fear of losing any weapons or otherwise having to deal with unwanted mechanics. </p>

<p>I think there is some merit to the argument of having Premium tickets (Duskruin) and Basic tickets (DM/EG).  My only concern is when people stockpile them. (Because they have, do and will.)

<p>That about nails it on the head. It's not an easy thing to fix by any means. Economies of any scale are delicate things that don't always play by the rules. </p>

<p>Despite how it may seem, I think for the most part that duskruin balancing of costs is pretty fair. There are some things I really don't agree with (Smithy service charge when using bloodscrip) but I think the high-end shop is mostly working as intended.</p></div></article><article id="post-5929" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 6:13:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>We wouldn't allow conversions into blackscrip, bloodscrip, ethereal scrip, seashells, or silvers.

<p>DSD also costs a lot more.  We balanced it on how many seashells someone gets at 1500 SimuCoins.  Games and digging also carry more chances to get uniques and jackpots compared to 15 runs of DSD if you sink the time in.</p>

<p>What do you mean?  They can get 250 bloodscrip in a single run at Duskruin Arena or 2 to 3 in the sewers.  Digging/games is going to take a considerable amount of time.

<p>I have in my spreadsheet 181 items so far, and I'm still finding new items.</p>

<p>Despite your post on the officials, I'm still finding lots of things that can't be pawned.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm sleep deprived, but I have no idea how anyone is enjoying this more than just getting tickets for the lower tiers. We're being bombarded with items we have to do something with.

<p>I kind of have to agree with this -- I'd like everyone to be happy as well, of course, but if you're going to lean one direction... I would think it would be favoring the people who sink tons of time into DOING the thing, rather than the people doing it a couple of times for kicks.  Having said fluff items available is a great thing, but I think the problem with last year wasn't JUST the absence of things dropping, it was that the prize walls felt a little lackluster; I thought the selections were fine, personally, but that's what I generally heard.  Of course, I also heard a lot of people were pretty happy about the lack of huge mountains of crap... but that's also entirely anecdotal.</p>

<p>Another obvious point in favor of less junk would be sparing the system (and us) from having huge numbers of items pawned/dropped/left scattered everywhere.  It just gets... messy, and creates far more screen-scroll when people pick up/sort/sell things.  Dropping the number by 75% certainly helps a lot, but I would be hugely in favor of going back to nothing under T4.  That felt like SUCH an improvement last year, it's rather unfortunate to see it take even a small a step back... but again, that's just my opinion.  It's still certainly far better than all the years before last.</p>

<p>I can't personally fathom WHY anyone would complain about NOT having to deal with junk, because I can't wrap my head around why finding your dozenth pair of sandals/incense/whatever would qualify as "more exciting"... but to each their own, I guess.  A few solutions suggested were either a FLAG that might automatically convert junk prizes (before/during actually generating them as loot) into a marginal amount of shells or whatever -- which might also help balance more shells into digging and help it feel less "grindy" for those larger goals -- OR a second digging area where such would occur as an alternative to the "junk pile" digging areas.</p></div></article><article id="post-6074" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, October 7th, 2017, 6:35:00 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>So this is definitely where the tiered system of passes has been a good thing, at least for me.  If I'd have spent the $50 up front, I'd be far more disappointed in the games.  Now at least I've only spent $15 on the 1500 simucoins to do games.  My thought going in to games though was that I wanted to generate enough seashells to buy one of the new climate wear tunics.  Those are 1000 seashells.  At my current rate of 50 seashells per 200 digs, it will end up costing me 4 million silvers to buy one, which is just insane and of course I'm not going to do that anymore.  I'm not saying I'm not interested in buying anything else, but at this point, I wish I would have held off on buying a games pass and just waited until the secondary market for seashells establishes itself and bought seashells for silvers.</p>

<p>Edit: @Wyrom I see how you mentioned on the officials that you quadrupled the rate at which seashells drop, so we'll see how this goes.

You offer to sell your tentacle-carved runestone to the pawnbroker.
The pawnbroker smiles faintly and says, "I'm sorry, but I have no use for that."</p>

<p>You analyze your tentacle-carved runestone and sense that there is no recorded information on that item.</p>

A slimy squid tentacle
A grey-tinged flacon
a carnelian pumpkin candle decorated with hunter green vines

<p>As GM Haliste stated, the Live Games are more closely related to raffle wins than games like digging and diving. Digging and diving games are automated. This is the reason they are grouped with a merchant/services pass instead of a games pass.</p>

<p>The following live games require a services pass to participate:</p>

<p>Salvaged by the Sea - A new scavenger hunt/puzzle game which employs some added logic components.</p>

<p>Sing Me an Epitaph - Create a poem to match various scraps of paper within the 15 minute time limit.</p>

<p>Anemone Anagrams - Unscramble the words to solve the puzzle (Fun Fact: Anemone is an anagram for "name one.")</p>

<p>Search and Rescue - A scored game of hide and seek with the residents of Caligos Isle. How many Caligots can you find?</p>

<p>Entrails Toss - Toss entrails and score points based on hit location.</p>

<p>Pick Yer Poison - Who doesn't love a drinking game? Be the last one to NOT get a bad drink.</p>

<p>First, second and third place winners will be escorted into the lighthouse to claim their prize. Note that there is more than one prize list; the prize list MAY be different for different games. Some prizes are able to be redeemed on the spot and some may be delayed services that go through QC.</p>

<p>Just a suggestion ...</p>

<p>In this room:
[Caligos Isle, High Promontory]
In those rare moments when the fog lifts from the area, the view of the western sea is nothing short of spectacular from this promontory outcropping of basalt.  Peering down, however, is ill-advised for the faint of heart, as the drop-off is steep and the surface of the churning water is a long way down.  A long length of knotted hemp rope dissappears over the side of the cliff, and a plank and chain ladder vanishes upwards, all but lost in the thick, grey mist rolling down from the higher peaks</p>

<p>Add a hut:
Inside the hut you sell the following:
* a brown leather bellows
* a wooden steel-tipped harpoon
* a woven fishing net
Remove these items from the hoppers.</p>

<p>Add the seashell bucket for sale in this hut, for silvers.</p></div></article><article id="post-6113" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, October 7th, 2017, 2:51:59 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>YAY WYROM</p>

<p>Oh, the odds of getting a T4 are much better on DSD, no doubt.  But spell preps and custom bolts etc. seem very, very slanted to fishing.  My understanding is that the original prize lists those were ONLY on fishing, and some were moved.</p>

<p>However, as it stands right now... getting a scroll with 402 on it isn't very impressive to me compared to a Spell Prep.</p></div></article><article id="post-6172" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Erous</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 8th, 2017, 5:03:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@wyrom said in <a href="/post/6161">Official: Ebon Gate - Diving, Fishing, Questing</a>:</p>

<p>Information will be available when it's ready to be shared. Seashells are considered incidental loot with Ebon Gate (the opposite of what bloodscrip are considered at Duskruin), and the purpose of the games are to find something exciting (T4 through T6).
