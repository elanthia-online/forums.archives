This is an accomplishment since we've been together since 2006. He tried the game in 2010 and didn't like it, but things seem to be going better this time.</p>

<p>He's been <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/midnight_gg">streaming his noob adventures</a> on and off for the past few days and has gotten a few donations from members of the GS community. To thank everyone for watching and enjoying his antics,  he wants to use those donations to <strong>give away a 50-count <a href="https://gswiki.play.net/Duskruin_Arena">Duskruin</a> booklet</strong> to one lucky person that follows his stream.</p>

<p>All you have to do for a chance to win is follow his stream. </p>

<p>The giveaway itself will likely happen on Friday, before Duskruin opens. More details to follow!</p></div></article><article id="post-1743" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 2:33:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Who marries a Draven player?
