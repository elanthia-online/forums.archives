<p>As someone who has built in the region the past couple of years, the restrictions are a little tighter than that. Like nothing out the Postern gate, nothing in Sylvarraend or Cysaegir, and generally nothing wherever GM Valyrka doesn't want.</p></div></article><article id="post-7105" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, October 31st, 2017, 2:19:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Why nothing in Cysaegir?
