<p>7)<strong>a small carnelian-hued codex</strong>
Invoking this carnelian-hued codex will grant you permanent access to a special method of preparing your spells.
It will provide the following phrase:
First Person:  With a rush of mana, carnelian foxfire flares to life and engulfs your hands in an ethereal glow...
Third Person:  Ethereal carnelian foxfire flickers into being along Azaton's hands, slithering across his palms...
Hidden or Invisible:  Ethereal carnelian foxfire flickers in the shadows.
CB:1.9m to Zoeybeth Twice!</p>

<p>8)<strong>a glass dollhouse trinket</strong>
The creator has also provided the following information:
This is a prize token that, once REDEEMed, will "Grant you the ability to summon a Dollhouse Bedroom major sanctuary.  You must have knowledge of this spell to use it.  At this time, redemption of this customization will PERMANENTLY disable default messaging of this spell."
The effect of this token is cosmetic.  It does not increase the effect or damage caused by a spell.
This item does NOT grant spell knowledge.  REDEEMing this item assumes that the player already has the ability to cast the customized spell either from an item, Spell Knowledge, or having the spell cast upon you, if applicable.
MB:1m</p>

<p>9)<strong>a small locker expansion contract</strong>
+10 locker slots
CB:2.5m to Losus SOLD!

<p>This was a T5 prize last ebon gate as a set and comes in a striated black cypress box. The analyze on some of these items is far too long to post here, just ask I can send it to you or meet you in game.
The mask is a fully unlocked Duplicity mask
The gown is a fully unlocked Peretta gown.
The gloves have a wear, pull and wave messaging.
The slippers can shuffle with a little ballerina-like dance.
