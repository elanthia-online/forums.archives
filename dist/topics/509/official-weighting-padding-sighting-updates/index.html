<ul>
<li>W/P/S scale values between breakpoints will now provide a % chance equal to the progress towards the next breakpoint to increase the combat effectiveness to the next value. 
This increase will also very slightly increase the difficulty of Enchanting or Ensorcelling W/P/S items by adding the same percentage of the next rank penalty to the difficulty.</li>
</ul>

<p>&lt;<ex. 25 points of weighting will now be 2pts of combat effectiveness with a 5/10 (50%) chance to provide a combat effectiveness of 3pts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Warrior Assess has been enhanced to now provide some detailed information on W/P/S as a OOC note after the normal assess messaging. This will include scale points, points needed to the next breakpoint, % chance to 'rank up', the service count and service window time left if present.</li>
</ul>

<p>&lt;<ex. [A mithril handaxe has a combat effectiveness rating of 4 points of Damage weighting and a 50.0% chance to have a combat effectiveness rating of 5. It has 5 of 10 services towards the next full rank of combat effectiveness. It also has a combat effectiveness rating of 10 points of Critical weighting and a 76.6% chance to have a combat effectiveness rating of 11. It has 23 of 30 services towards the next full rank of combat effectiveness. It has been serviced 10 times in this service window, which resets in 2d 21h 40m.]</p>

<ul>
<li>The AI crystal, weapon identifying sheaths, and other items that detect item properties should now be identifying the new WPS properties.</li>

<p>Hello Fellow Elanthians,</p>

<p>I've just released an update that allows Premium Point benefits to interact with the W/P/S changes. As before, Sadie reserves all final say in surchages and pricing when the service is being done.</p>

<p>Premium Point Padding
- Using Premium Points to add padding will function as it did before, and bring armor UP TO 150 services (10pts of Combat Effectiveness) of padding. Given that multiple types of padding can exist on the same item, you can now choose to split those 150 services across both Critical and Damage padding if you so choose.
- Pricing for padding has been updated to allow padding on flaring, TD Bonus, Offensive Bonus, etc. Adding Padding to a set of armor with any of these attributes has a surcharge of 1500 points.
- Due to enchanting of padding items being available, pricing for PP Padding will now always price armor below 4x enchant as if it were 4x. No changes to costs above 4x.
- All other surcharges for padding remains as it was before.</p>

<p>Premium Point Flaring
Flares added via Premium Points may now also be added to weighted or padded items that are 150 services or under. The surcharge is 20 PP per service of weighting, or 10 PP per service of padding. All other surcharges remain the same.</p>

<p>Scripted Items
PCALC will now include the surcharge for item scripts (if possible) and include that in the estimate given. If a script cannot be identified as fluff, combat simple, or combat complex yet it will default to assuming it is combat complex and will send a notification for us to review.</p>

<p>Premium 9 has been updated to reflect all of these changes as well.</p>

one of the best values of pp usage by far, gone.</p></div></article><article id="post-8065" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, December 29th, 2017, 6:56:28 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Quote from GM Coase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Okay, yeah, we'll just blame the other GMs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not about blaming anyone. We had one one system of padding/weighting for over 20 years. Most of our GMs have been GMing for 5-10 years or more and have it solidly set in their mind. Events are also often planned in advance. It takes a bit of time and pushing to swap from one solidly entrenched system to a brand new one. Its is not "lies" that we're trying to make this more available (and we have), but we're also not at the end point of this system transition either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My take from the wps changes was that I would be able to obtain it at anytime barring the ever increasing costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not entirely what we have in mind, no. If you're expecting to be able to plan for 15.8 services per month to hit a goal value in exactly 40 months, then that is a level of precision that we are -not- aiming for. However, we are aiming for you to be able to make measurable progress with your item based on how much effort you put into attending merchants and quest events, which we do want to have consistently (but not constantly or permanently) available.</p>

<p>We have been making strides to automate where we can. The most merchant-heavy events in the more recent times have been events like RtCF/CCF, but we had pretty heavy attendance limitations and time limits to produce services. And during other events, we also have pretty big restriction lists that have for the most part been lessened or removed. You can also build some pretty awesome equipment now with freeing up the slot that WPS took. Automation does have to come with caveats though. It's the nature of the beast. But if you look at where we are today from the game of 2007, we are offering so much more.</p>

<p>We already offered more in 2017 than we have in any previous year. We serviced 484 characters at August's Duskruin alone. Yes, it can be argued that it wasn't HCW for everyone, but that's a lot better than 20 to 30 people for the entire year of 2017 like every year prior. We'd never be able to do live merchanting to service those kind of numbers though. Live merchanting, while personable and interactive, is extremely limiting.</p>

<p>This was just launched in August of 2017, looking at the offerings, we really did offer it a whole lot. We have plans to offer it even more in 2018, both at events like Duskruin and world events. As Coase mentioned, if you were expecting to progress an item rapidly, that wasn't the intended route of the system. But it is to hit a lot more players more frequently. It's not aimed to just service the same group of items like we've seen over the last 5 years.</p>

The only shining light is that they can now milk people for more money along the long long road to adding two kinds of weighting to items, over years and hundreds/thousands of dollars that will never be seen by GMs because they automated everything.</p></div></article><article id="post-8077" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, December 29th, 2017, 2:30:59 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>sad part is Dev team so fucking stupid and greedy they cant see the obvious make everyone happy answer :
Leave a smithy in every town for scaling silvers costs - help offset the silver issues
duskruin smithy has no scaling costs - flat BS costs means people can pay their cash for HCP instantly at similar rates, no more double/triple dipping with the scaling costs now costing additional $$
BUTT ORDIM! THE BALANCE WONT SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE BALANCE? 
Once again, Retser saves everyone's ass by being A GOOD GM and already has the answer - the ability he put on the tanto that removes padding from things - give that to random monsters in a new are or sprinkle it on existing monsters as needed.</p></div></article><article id="post-8078" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, December 29th, 2017, 2:31:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>In before "but changing things is hard"</p></div></article><article id="post-8082" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">SaltySenorita</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, December 29th, 2017, 6:15:37 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The shitstorm that would ensue if existing creatures could strip padding/weighting/sighting...</p></div></article><article id="post-8083" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, December 29th, 2017, 6:26:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@saltysenorita said in <a href="/post/8082">Official: Weighting/Padding/Sighting Updates</a>:</p>
