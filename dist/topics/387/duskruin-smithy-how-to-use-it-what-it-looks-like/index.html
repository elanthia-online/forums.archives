  A dwarven blacksmith assistant steps in front of you and states, "Alastir, before I review my list, be sure you're absolutely certain that you're prepared to do business with the blacksmith.  You'll need to earn a new invite should you go in and leave."  The assistant continues, "If you're absolutely sure you're ready, then just head inside again within ten seconds."</p>
  
  <p>go arch

<p>[Bloodforge, Smithy - ]
Bursts of heat drift in from an adjacent room, and a sulfuric scent lingers in the air.  A blackened pine sawhorse draped with layers of thick padding is nudged against a large worktable cluttered with numerous knives, tongs, chisels, and a variety of other instruments.  Burning embers escape from a small furnace in a fiery crimson spray and threaten to set the worktable ablaze.  You also see an old dwarven blacksmith.

<p>yeah there was a difference between the release post and the appraisal in that the release post said that the price would increase per service ON THE FIFTH, but the appraisal showed the increase AFTER THE FIFTH. @Wyrom @Estild</p></div></article></div></body></html>
