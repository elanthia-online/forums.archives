<p>I am forever in your debt time4fun, for allowing me a clean slate.  I will do the same with you, given your less than perfect record on the other forums.</p>

<p>Perhaps.. but since Wyrom is taking a far more active role in these "unofficial" player run forums and Simutronics has a very strict "No cash for GS items" policy, I thought it would be good to get clarification.</p>

<p>Isn't the "no cash for GS items" policy more of a legal buffer than something that has ever once in the history of GS been enforced? Ever?

<p>I'm sure that is the real motivation behind it, since many GMs have sold items for real life cash in the past.</p>

<p>Hi @Parkbandit !!! It's great to see you here, @Parkbandit !!! I haven't made it to the end of the thread yet but I'd still like to help, so here goes! And if you've already been helped, @Parkbandit , even better!</p>
