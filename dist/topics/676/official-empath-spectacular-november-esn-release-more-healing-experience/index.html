<p>On the second day of ESN:</p>

<p>1) The amount of experience awarded from abdomen, chest, back, and neck wounds has been increased! All of these wound types were awarding less experience than we felt they should be given the severity of bleeding they can cause as well as the mana/RT cost and time to heal them. For those curious about numbers, this ROUGHLY equates to an 18% overall increase in the amount of experience gained from healing.</p>

<p>2) Empaths level 1 to 10 get a buff to experience starting at a 2.0 multiplier at level 1 and decreasing by 0.1 every level until level 11. This change was made to encourage players who made an empath with the goal of healing to be able to do that with more ease early on.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions/thoughts/concerns. Enjoy!</p>
