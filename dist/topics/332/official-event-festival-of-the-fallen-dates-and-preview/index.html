<p>Hello again everyone. The dates for Festival of the Fallen are confirmed and it will run from September 7th through September 10th. Grounds will open at 4pm Eastern on the 7th and close at midnight eastern on the 10th. For those of you who missed it last time, this is a martial themed event with gladiator pits and a tournament. GM Zoelle, GM Kynlee, and I have worked very hard to try to bring you a wide variety of services, shops, and fun. I look forward to seeing everyone there!</p>

<p>Arena - We will be having the arena contest again this year and more information about entering will be coming shortly. Some changes have been made to the combat based on feedback from previous runs. More details to come! The tournament will be held on Friday the 8th in Plat and the 9th in Prime.</p>

<p>Shops – Yep, we'll have lots! Some you've seen before with all new exciting merchandise and others you haven't!</p>

<p>Games – You bet we have the dagger toss and hatchet throw again, with several nice things in the unique hopper!.</p>

<p>Services – Raffles and auctions abound!</p>

<p>A royal ball – (I'm looking at you Nihrvanah). What would a bloody gore-filled festival be if without scrubbing down and dressing up when it's all over? Ball will be held from 9 pm eastern to 11 pm eastern on Sunday in Prime. (Time for Plat's is still pending)</p>

<p>Teasers – RSN!</p>

  <p>So on the sonic raffle does the bard already have to be able to sing the song? Also not finding the raffle so far.</p>

<p>No weighting, nothing higher than 7x enchants, no claidmores or katanas, no combat scripts. Please be willing to work with us as other restrictions MAY apply, but we'll be checking it on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>&lt; Are there no small shields available or are they just tucked out of sight?</p>

<p>No, there are no small shields this year. But! If you have one (non-fusion) bring it by when Grobey's around and he may be able to add his script to it for you!</p>

<p>Posting that question on the officials, in the festival folder, is the likely fastest way to get an answer.

<p>The auction will be held in the Gilded Longsword, Taproom at 9 elven in Prime and 9:45 elven in Plat.</p>

  <p>Good morning, could someone provide clarification on why there are two sets of brigandine in Rikelle’s Protect and Serve morphing armor shop that have different costs? They both analyze as off the shelf unlock, but one costs 280k and the other 325k. There is a different description on one, but I wasn’t sure if that was the reason for the higher cost.</p>

<p>One set is imflass which comes at a naturally reduced weight (it naturally weighs less than vultite) and costs a bit more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you clarify if the climatewear needs to be at a certain tier to recieve this service? I assume that it needs to be fully unlocked already, but I wanted to be sure. Thanks!</p>

<p>It does not. I will be unlocking the cloak to the appropriate level and I will be adding the hood. However, the cloak DOES need to have the climatewear script already attached to it as I will not be adding it.</p>

<p>There are a few certificates in the hopper that allow Rikelle to add her morphing armor ability to existing fusion armor.</p>
