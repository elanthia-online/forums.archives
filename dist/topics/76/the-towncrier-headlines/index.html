The TownCrier channel went live on LNet on March 11, 2016. Hosted by your friendly news anchor, <strong>Newsby</strong>, the TownCrier is published with ongoing daily updates by a dedicated team of creatives.</p>

<p>The TownCrier Project came to be because who wants to have to choose between roleplaying or looking in multiple places for what's going on in GS? It was named after the first magazine of Elanthia, The TownCrier of GemStone II from 1988-1989. </p>

<p>When we are given enough lead time, headlines stay on the live newsfeed for 5 to 6 days.</p>

<p>The TownCrier Team includes dedicated creatives for all sorts of things GemStone! If you're interested in helping, please let me know. There's room for ideas and help within the project as I try to make sure nobody gets burned out from the daily nature of the deadlines.</p>

<p>You'll find the full news headlines every 5 minutes on the TownCrier channel of LNet:</p>
