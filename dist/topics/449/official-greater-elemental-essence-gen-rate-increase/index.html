<p>The chance to upgrade an elemental essence into a greater essence has been increased. Starting from level 50 up to 100, it scales to twice the previous rate.</p>

<p>I think if W/P/S can be done without potions, flares should be as well. Wizards are masters of the elements, why do they need help with flares? ditto with the harsh lore requirements.  If anything, the potions, lore reqs are at the levels of ridonkulous it should take for adding flares.  I am usually a lover of high thresholds, lore training, guild training, etc, but opening the W/P/S up like that calls for a re-examination as it really doesn't seem right now.</p></div></article><article id="post-4511" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 9:49:41 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I believe I saw mention that the number of essences dropping, compared to the number of people actually USING them, means that someone, somewhere, has a giant vault of them that they swim through, scrooge mcduck style.</p></div></article><article id="post-4512" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">darconas</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 9:54:46 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Flare enchanting has been a complete bust.

<p>It makes no sense to me why flaring weapons require special potions.  9 out of 10 people prefer weighting to flares.  Placing flares behind absurd restrictions just means they'll never be worked on, which doesn't really matter, because barely anyone uses them over weighting.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know why the DEV team thinks flares should be placed behind a frustrationwall.  @Estild ?</p></div></article><article id="post-4517" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 10:32:25 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir Mostly pures with runestaves and warmages.</p></div></article><article id="post-4518" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 10:39:55 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>As a master alchemist... lets hold on a second... more veteran, readily available objects have dipped in price since inception.  You're now looking at Ayveneh potions not offering the same return on investment as when they were first released, as a result of more alchemists producing higher supplies.</p>

<p>Yes, scarcity in reagents suck... but there have never been as many master alchemists as a percentage of the population compared to today.  The likelihood of finding someone to change X to Y is more realistic now more than ever.</p>

<p>That being said... Hoarding alchemy reagents is the bigger problem... if I have a session of performing alchemy, it's usually a task in cleaning my nice gems off of Whirlin, moving a packed to capacity 120 pound, 100 item shoulder container from a mule onto Whirlin, performing alchemy, and moving it all back.  I think this can HELP be remediated through utilization of those capsules created an event or two ago that held a few of the chronomage orbs, and applying towards *ayanad crystals, essences, shards, and motes to help further drive down numbers.  Perhaps even considering an alchemy cauldron weight reduction (as a halfling, I will not lug around a 5 pound cauldron all the time!)</p></div></article><article id="post-4520" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 10:45:09 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/4513">Official: Greater Elemental Essence Gen Rate Increase</a>:</p>
