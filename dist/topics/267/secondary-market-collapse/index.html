<p>It's actually a self-adjusting cycle.

<p>Tgo is cashing out because he sees everyone else cashing out and wants to get out before rock bottom. There are six or seven threads on the PC all offering 200+ million silvers each at dirt prices, because everyone sees the writing on the wall. </p>

<p>As far as @Wyrom is concerned, I wouldn't hold my breath for an easing of concerns about Simucoins. He's been shaking my faith in him for a year or more and it's becoming clear that a massive portion of the game's development is going to developing new and adjusting old systems to function only via secondary purchases beyond the largest monthly subscription fee of any modern game. And that's not even counting ticket prices.

<p>There is no downplaying needed. All one has to do is compare two years ago to today to see the effect Simucoin based development has had on the game. Silvers have sharply declined in value, from $10-12 per million to now $4-6 with no sign of rebounding. Every event now has at least a strong Simucoin component. A good portion of events now are ONLY accessible via Simucoin. And now the ticketed events are also going to be largely Simucoin based, in addition to the ticket costs. In addition to the subscription costs. </p>

<p>When posed with the question "Is my $20 or $40 per month as valuable now as it was two years ago? Can I get the same benefits now as I did then for that monthly investment?", the answer is, unequivocally: No. The development the game is receiving is going now largely to systems I don't use, to try to squeeze blood from a stone. </p>

<p>They've added a few things here and there for those people pathetic enough to only invest the highest monthly subscription rate of any modern game. Somehow, some way, that gives certain people a reason to state that everything is perfect and normal, but it has absolutely no bearing on the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>It makes me think about the story of the frog in the pot. The frog doesn't notice the water getting warmer right up until the point that it's boiled and dies.</p></div></article><article id="post-2609" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 2:04:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>From my post on the PC:</p>

<p>No Box Office ticket this time.

<p>Good. I hope they make money hand over fist from it. Because it's a completely separate event from the regular game and you really miss out on nothing important if you don't participate, I don't care how they choose to monetize it. What I do know is this: I have, lifetime, spent $0 on Ebon's Gate. I would never have bought a $50 ticket for it. There is now a non-zero chance I spend a little money on it. I'm not alone in this boat, and I would be willing to bet people like me more than makes up for the loss in ticket revenue.</p>

<p>I dunno about most people being upset about it being the high rollers.  However, these threads have absolutely shown that there's a small number of people who are REALLY upset, which is normal.  the fact that more people than ever are participating in pay events, where each event pulls in several months worth of sub money, that's what's important.</p>

<p>For those who are really upset at the new model, don't participate.  It's the best way to send feedback.  Threats and other doomsaying is meaningless.  stop paying.  If you feel you aren't getting your money worth, quit.</p>

<p>also, it's funny to watch, the people who are really upset all act like anybody who spends more than $20 on something must be a gambling addict.  The Whale tag doesn't even kick in  until you spend $1000 a MONTH on a game, btw.  Most of the people that are being called whales are just pay players.  And Most people who spend even more than a grand aren't helpless addicts who don't know what they're doing, they're people with a lot of disposable income who choose to spend it on the game.</p>

<p>Heck, I'm sure a lot of you spend that much or more on your kids.  What you choose to do with your life, and money, is up to you.</p></div></article><article id="post-2634" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 3:31:49 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim said in <a href="/post/2632">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

<p>I suggest making suggestions. I suggested making enhancive recharging for silvers (order 99) work year-round.</p>

<p>I think the re-release of Playershops will be helpful as more active shop keepers put their items out that can be conveniently purchased for silvers.</p></div></article><article id="post-2646" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 3:52:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@flimbo said in <a href="/post/2628">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

    <p>When posed with the question "Is my $20 or $40 per month as valuable now as it was two years ago? Can I get the same benefits now as I did then for that monthly investment?", the answer is, unequivocally: No. The development the game is receiving is going now largely to systems I don't use, to try to squeeze blood from a stone. </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>What benefits have been removed from your $20 a month that now necessitate buying simucoins?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ability to attain items of value through in game means only. Who's gonna sell high end stuff for silvers when silvers become worthless? People are already on the verge of not accepting silvers for books and bloodscrip.</p>

<p>People will stop selling high end items for silver altogether if silvers are worthless, which leaves Simucoins/cash as the only way to get anything that isn't just some off the shelf 4x trash. I'll be surprised if people are still selling books for silvers at the next DR run.</p>

<p>Simu is jerking each other off over short term gains that will come at the expense of the game's long term life, and I think things are going to take a much bigger shit than they're expecting once silvers become completely worthless.</p>

<p>Wyrom claims that silvers will still be useful, but I don't recall him explaining how that will be the case, and needing coins to buy that quartz orb for 500 coins in the pawnshop doesn't exactly count.</p>

<p>I also think it's hilarious that Simu complains about lack of silver drains with zero priority on fixing it while simultaneously flooding silvers into the game via DR. Maerit was saying that they've made more coins in a single DR run than they've made in the past decade of normal gameplay.</p>

<p>The only way to keep silvers useful at this point that I can think of is to attach a silver cost to bloodscrip items. Which they won't do because they see silvers as a potential player to player transaction which in their eyes is a lost opportunity to sell more Simucoins. The player who does everything in game only doesn't exist to Simu anymore, not in any meaningful way anyway.</p></div></article><article id="post-2648" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 3:56:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Get your ensorcelling done!

  <p>Simu has been doing box office stuff since before the model even existed.  The emphasis to move from the Box Office to leverage the Simucoin only enables them to create a single-stream of content/box-office/event related purchases, allowing them to decommission the Box office and have savings with manual processes to set up particular events/whatnots, enabling them to dedicate more resources to new development efforts rather than keeping legacy processes alive.  Lets take a look at Ebon's Gate for instance... that was always a paid event on top of subscription cost.  Simu did it before micro-transactions.</p>

<p>I have a love/hate relationship with the current way that Gemstone is priced for services/subscriptions/events.</p>

<p>First of all let me say that I too think that silvers are being devalued and that there needs to be a change to insert more PERCEIVED and ACTUAL value for silvers into the system. Note: This is not the same as a silver drain, which I feel isnt the solution we need at present.</p>

<p>Multi-ticket raffles for mid/high-end items are a good one. That way if something comes up that someone REALLY wants, they can pump all their silver into an increased chance to win.</p>

<p>Annual, even SEMI-annual Silver Only auctions for some low, mostly mid, a few High-end items would also go a LONG way to making people really value silver. Put some teasers up 1-2 months before and watch people try and swallow up all the silver.</p>

<p>Create a capped hunting area that requires a pass that must be renewed each week...and can only be renewed for a High amount of silver. This can be extended throughout the level ranges, actually....and be sort of like a 'premium' hunting area for those who are Rich. Make it attractive enough that this is something people will seek to hunt in.</p>

<p>To steal an idea from EVE ONLINE: Sell 'Gift of Adventures' in game for silver. 50 million for a month  of 'free' premium subscription. </p>

<p>These are three off the cuff ideas that would go far to alleviating the problem.</p>

<p>That being said: Keep the Duskruin how it is and other SIMUCOIN ONLY events and services. Let people choose which they want to spend: Their money or their time.</p>

<p>Gemstone is a business. It needs to make money. And quite frankly, Im damn glad of these events that give me...the non-rich player...a chance at some high end gear without having to go through some 'in game greedy ass merchant' to get it. I don't want to have to deal with the markup the haves give to some of these items.

<p>EVE doesn't sell PLEX directly to players.  A player can buy an extra PLEX, and then use the in-game market to sell it to another player.  It's no different than what we currently have.

<p>No, they don't have the problem licked. Most MMOs have trouble with inflation. The difference though is that Gemstone has been directly causing the problem these last few years. They've flat out stopped attempting to take silvers out of the system in favor of creating 10 different other currencies that can be purchased with dollars, and gating different types of items that you may want behind those alternate currencies instead of silvers. They're actively devaluing their own primary currency, on purpose, which is one of the things I take issue with.</p></div></article><article id="post-2665" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 4:39:38 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@hjfudge said in <a href="/post/2663">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

<p>You know they're gonna steal that idea now, act like they came up with it on their own, axe the refund part, release a watered down version of the Ranger's Guild (random example) and then decide they need another crowdfund to fix it while keeping all their other nickel and dime rackets intact. And they'll give the GMs who actually coded it like $15 and a pack of smokes or something and chalk up the rest to fire extinguisher inspection costs.</p>

<p>I bet they'd like nothing better than to have a discussion about concerns.  I bet if there was give and take, and if it were legally permissible (those damn NDAs), we'd find quite a few GMs who really do want to kick back, put up their feet and dream along with us.</p>

<ol>
<li>The current SimuCoin system, like it or not, is not going away soon.</li>
<li>It is very important to have the primary in-game currency possess value.</li>
<li>The primary in-game currency is rapidly losing its value.</li>
</ol>

<p>If bloodscrip becomes the primary currency, I don't think that's good for the game's health, especially if the only realistic way to acquire it is through SimuCoin purchases. So that means either silvers need to gain value or bloodscrip needs to be more accessible. I have to imagine the development staff keeps an eye on the secondary market and how it reflects the health of the game. So I bet this sort of thing is being monitored.</p>

<p>There's been a lot of good suggestions here. I wouldn't mind seeing things like the limited ability to purchase SimuCoin items via silver. Flimbo's idea is good in theory but not the right choice for a game as messy to develop as Gemstone. If people are crowdfunding, they're going to pay up front, and when things don't go as planned or promised (and they won't), it's going to be a nightmare for everyone involved. It could also lead to a few people just throwing their weight around and determining the direction of the game- and you don't want that.</p>

<p>I also wonder if maybe the silver issue is tied to the ever-growing capped population and the fact there's really nothing for them to do other than the occasional new hunting areas. This could be a growing problem.</p></div></article><article id="post-2730" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 9:31:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@doug said in <a href="/post/2714">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

<p>Oh what a load of bull. If there were some kind of NDA in place that prevented the <strong>product manager</strong> of the game from having a discussion about legitimate concerns about it, then these forums wouldn't exist in the first place. I zero percent believe that the product manager of this game is not involved in the decision-making process that determines the development schedule of the game for which they are the product manager. There is no shadowy Illuminati in the background pulling the strings and cackling maniacally while preventing that person from talking to us about it.</p>

<p>Wyrom is making decisions, and these forums were made on the understanding that Wyrom would be able to reach out to us here because the company "cannot afford" to upkeep its own forums in a way that's consistent with the basic standards of the internet in 2005, much less 2017. This thread is no different than any thread where he can bang the marketing drum about what he's having his team release next, except for the fact that there's virtually no way for him to address any concern here without taking at least some responsibility for the fact that a number of <strong>his</strong> decisions have had a wildly negative impact on the game and its economy.</p>

<p>And that's a shame, because there are a number of good corrective ideas here, and solid dialogue between the players that could be very helpful for the company in determining its course of action going forward for continued profitability. Companies that put on blinders to their customers needs and just bang out ideas that bring in cash grabs in the quickest way possible tend to fail. Fast. And the change in overall development strategy since Wyrom has taken over reeks of short term cash grab.</p></div></article><article id="post-2732" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Doug</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 9:42:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@flimbo said in <a href="/post/2730">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

<p>I don't think the game would die, but I do think the game would shrink. There is a portion of the population that plays in large part to generate wealth. If doing so was negatively effected, their experience would be negatively effected. One can safely assume a portion of those players would leave.</p>

<p>For some, the draw of going to events is the chance to win big ticket items which they can turn around and sell for a profit. If the means to obtain that profit are curtailed, it'll mean less enthusiasm for big ticket events, resulting in less tickets sold.</p>

<p>If you're comfortable with buying items for cash, then little will change beyond silver becoming even easier to acquire for the few reasons to accrue it beyond buying items from players. However, if you typically prefer to buy items and services from players using silver, it will be increasingly difficult to find anyone willing to part with their items for a reasonable amount of it, or even accepting silver at all. Another net loss.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe a segment of the population doesn't want to walk away from the game due to the perceived worth of their characters. If silvers fall in value, that worth declines. If it is more difficult to convert their items to dollars, that worth declines.

There's a balancing act though, as the fact that so many people go to events to turn a profit / flip the items has also been mentioned as a negative element for many people going to events ("Why bother going, only the people with more money than sense to buy the wins gets anything anyway" etc.).</p>

<p>So while there's a segment of the game that may not like the changes, there's another segment that may feel the changes are very helpful.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it will come down to whatever ends up making the game the most profitable and brings in players.  Until people make good on their threats to quit over the current value of silver, no change will happen, in part because people have been threatening to quit for twenty years, so it's really an empty threat.  And if the people who quit are all the known farmers, it's unlikely to make much of an impact either.</p></div></article><article id="post-2788" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Avaia</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 11:03:26 AM</div></div><div class="content"><blockquote>

They should allow you to convert silvers into simucoins.  Yes, it means losing <em>immediate</em> cash from simucoin sales, but it means retaining players and subscriptions.</p>

<p>This sets the silver value at specific amounts.</p>

<p>The problem is that games print money, but don't limit the printing of money.  Unlike a fully functioning economy, you should never print endless amounts of money.  You need to print enough to keep the right amount in circulation, and make it harder to keep finding more and more money.  Items like gems, hides, pawnshop treasure allows the in-game system to print money.  That's why silver drain is necessary.  Since you can't prevent NPCs from issuing silvers, you need mechanics in place to ensure the amount of silvers issued by NPCs can drain a similar amount of silvers from players in the game.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be flat either.  It's a dynamic economy, and costs should change based on how much silver is in circulation.  Player markets are controlled by players, but in-game systems that generate silvers have no mechanism to prevent insane devaluing of the in-game currency.  If the entire game community generates 1 billion in silvers per week generated by hunting / selling at NPCs, then you need to have a mechanic in-game to drain at least HALF of that silver from the community.  That's how you keep a currency valid.</p>

<p>We do this in our daily lives.  The cost of living for a healthy adult usually accounts for 40-60% of their total income.  The other 60-40% goes into investments and improving your lifestyle.  Comparing real-world scenarios to online games is generally a bad idea, but real-world models for economies actually work in games.  If the community wants silvers to have value then:</p>

<ol>
<li>They need to be able to be used for real world purchases of some kind (trading them for simucoins)</li>
<li>You have to be willing to expense your silvers on a regular basis for in-game maintenance of your character (living expenses)</li>
</ol>

<p>Without these things, silvers will be easy to generate in the millions, and thus become worthless due to lack of demand.</p></div></article><article id="post-2812" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 1:30:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@hjfudge said in <a href="/post/2810">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

<p>Sure, but what do you <em>need</em> your silvers for?  If there's no in-game use for silvers that people need them for, then what are they worth?  What's the point in accumulating silvers?</p>

<p>Another thing people could use secondary currency for in Blade &amp; Soul, was buying "lottery" type boxes that awarded lots of goodies.  If you had enough gold, you could buy up a ton of coins from players, and do the BnS version of digging (without the tedium).  That made in-game currency valuable.

<p>This is probably a re-hash of the topic since I haven't been around, but honestly this looks like something worth investigating/fleshing out.  As it stands right now, recharging enhancive items requires game time in the form of bounty point payment.  Silvers is another version of game time, however there are a lot more freely dropped coins than bounties.  That said, there COULD be a formula for this that allows for the player to do either.  Those who don't have the in-game fat bank accounts can have the option of using bounty points, and those that do can recharge via silvers.  The trick is the amount.  It would need to be high enough to be an adequate silver drain, but not so high as to not be attainable.</p></div></article><article id="post-2860" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 3:43:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli </p>

<p>Oh fuck off with that "maybe I helped him" shit. </p>

<p>A: You dont actually know anything about his gambling habits, you are extrapolating based on PC posts and making assumptions that are both unfounded, and factually inaccurate.</p>

<p>B: Your comment about his NEED to recognize it AND seek treatment was way over the line, especially because of A.</p>

<p>Stop trying to spin it. It was a shit comment, nothing more nothing less. trying to defend it or make it not a shit comment just makes this way more of an issue than it needs to be. </p>

    <p>People have mentioned this before, but at very least it would be a <em>start</em> if they'd allow enhancive recharging for silvers (instead of bounty points) more than once a year--or even all the time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This is probably a re-hash of the topic since I haven't been around, but honestly this looks like something worth investigating/fleshing out.  As it stands right now, recharging enhancive items requires game time in the form of bounty point payment.  Silvers is another version of game time, however there are a lot more freely dropped coins than bounties.  That said, there COULD be a formula for this that allows for the player to do either.  Those who don't have the in-game fat bank accounts can have the option of using bounty points, and those that do can recharge via silvers.  The trick is the amount.  It would need to be high enough to be an adequate silver drain, but not so high as to not be attainable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, you shouldn't allow players to recharge with silvers - you should allow players an <strong>in-game</strong> method of trading their silvers for bounty points.  And the <em>only</em> way you can gain bounty points is by farming silvers, or completing AG quest.</p></div></article><article id="post-2884" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 4:41:53 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I stand by my opinion of his habits based on over a year of observation.

<p>From wikipedia.
Problem gambling (or ludomania, but usually referred to as "gambling addiction" or "compulsive gambling") is an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. Problem gambling is often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler's behaviour. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling is a common disorder that is associated with both social and family costs.</p>

<p>Please describe how Beld's enjoyment of gambling has led to any negative consequences for himself and others aside from the annoyance you personally feel.</p>

<p>If you can't, I hope you appreciate how diagnosing and recommending a treatment plan is the definition of shitty. </p>

<p>It's not shitty for you to point out that Beldannon annoys you, or that you are tired of hearing the same complaints. but it is shitty to be shitty, which you were.</p></div></article><article id="post-2887" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 5:20:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ososis said in <a href="/post/2855">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

<p>This isn't entirely accurate.  There are posts where Beldannon even says he has trouble stopping himself.  This indicates a desire to stop a behavior and an inability to do so.  While none of us are qualified to diagnose a disorder, it certainly seems by his own words he has an issue, which I believe is what Allereli is referring to.</p></div></article><article id="post-2888" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 5:22:40 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ososis said in <a href="/post/2886">Secondary Market Collapse</a>:</p>

I already stated previously none of us is qualified to make that diagnosis.  I think as logical human beings we can tell if someone has an issue with something though.  I have an alcohol problem, but I'm not an alcoholic.  I have issues, but I'm not an addict.  Good faith intervention?  Definitely not, just comments on a forum that has nothing to do with addiction.
