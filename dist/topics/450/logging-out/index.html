Even when I click the box that says remember me, I've had to log back in almost every time I've come here.  Heck, it's even logged me out while I was reading threads.</p>

<p>Other forums I am on I've rarely ever had to log in over the course of years.</p>

<p>Is that a 'feature' of these message boards or is something going wrong?</p></div></article><article id="post-4546" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 1:15:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>something else.
