<p>"Curious if anyone has Eleanore and would be willing to sell her?  Contacted the person I sold her to quite a few years ago but they are MIA at the moment.  Wondering if maybe she was sold off to someone else who might be active.  If anyone has any information then please give me a shout."</p>

<p>I have a soft spot for people trying to find old characters. Perhaps a kind gamemaster could tell us if the character is on an active or inactive account? @Wyrom </p>

<p>Many thanks!</p></div></article><article id="post-2834" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 2:45:25 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The character Eleanore is on an active account.
