I can't seem to look at the orbs for labels, but there may not be any on them anyway. </p>

<p>My thoughts are maybe the order of enhancive as seen by a bard would reflect the order of orbs?</p>

<p>the chambers currently hold a rich sunset orange orb, and a shining hoarfrost white orb.
The chamber surrounding a rich sunset orange orb is alive with steady radiance.  It appears to have come a bit loose in its depression, and could easily be pried free without causing any damage.</p>

<p>P.S. Has the safe removal of old-style orbs loose in the socket been discussed with all the fusion changes? It is also possible that this orb was loose prior to the changes.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
