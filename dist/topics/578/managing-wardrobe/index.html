<p>That's right.  Cool, thanks. I figured the armoire is the best method in the game for accomplishing this, but also wanted to try and get this completed through scripting.  I didn't expect to come across so many useful enhancives for my profession..so I guess I've been lucky.  I may try either your alias approach, OR, try just a simple SF script to remove and place assuming my enhancives stay stagnant.</p></div></article><article id="post-6636" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">mark</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 16th, 2017, 9:04:28 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There's a really simple script on the repo called enhancive. Doesn't use vars or anything, you just have to edit it and add the full descs of your enhancive items to an array.
It doesn't break on failing to put an item on or take it off (eg, if that location's full or you've already taken one of them off manually) but it works well enough that I don't bother looking for anything better.</p></div></article><article id="post-6637" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Erous</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 16th, 2017, 9:18:09 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>super, exactly what I was hoping for, thanks @mark</p></div></article></div></body></html>
