<blockquote>
  <p>rub my pipe
  You gently rub your pipe, and a pale blue glow surrounds the bowl. When the glow fades away your pipe is full of dark, aromatic tobacco.</p>
  
  <p>wave my pipe
  You wave your pipe around in a circle and the bowl of the pipe suddenly glows a bright cherry red! Soon fragrant smoke begins to rise into the air.</p>
  
  <p>kiss pipe
  You hold your pipe fondly.</p>
  
  <p>tap pipe
  You lean over and tap the bowl of your pipe on the ground, knocking out ash and bits of tobacco.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You puff contentedly on your bog-wood pipe. Small clouds of smoke drift past you as if playing a game of tag.</p>

<p>You puff contentedly on your bog-wood pipe. Several small clouds of smoke rise into the air as if playing tag before drifting away.</p>
