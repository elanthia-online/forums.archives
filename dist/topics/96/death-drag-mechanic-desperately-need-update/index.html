However, it was designed back in a different world, esp a smaller and more populated one.  </p>

<p>Today - there's so many more smaller races (forest gnomes, aleotoi, burghal), many more huntings areas, and overall bigger world.  Dying in the landing area is still ok but in RR, Teras, and even EN, especially during the off peak hours - there's a lot of hoping someone is around.</p>

<p>But even if someone is around, the weight mechanics is too strict.  As a non-fogger class, sometimes I really hate coming across a dead person or going for a rescue knowing its going to take tens of minutes or longer, just dragging, waiting, dragging, all the way to town.  Sometimes its so bad, it makes me want to not help.  That really is not where we want the game to go and we shouldn't punish people for helping.</p>

<p>I propose we significantly increase the weight limit for what races can drag.  Instead of the current system, I suggest something along these lines:</p>

<p>1) All races can drag all other races (RP it as creating a sling or dumping them in a wheelbarrow or something)
2) RT should only be given if the race/weights are on the farthest spectrum from each other (i.e. gnomes doing krolvins/giants) 
3) RT capped at 3-5 seconds per room
4) Eliminate the non-dragging room movements (i.e. can't drag them over rockslides, ice, etc - one time I was trying to drag someone thru the icemule trail and it was a horribly frustrating experience because it made me slip EVERYTIME, eventually they gave up and departed).
5) 2 people can drag any race with no RT</p>

<p>Considering people can walk around with 10-20 boxes weighing hundreds of pounds or items, dragging a person (not carrying) should not be a believably concern.     </p>

<p>Please please relook into this system and make it more friendly for the community  to help each other.</p></div></article><article id="post-567" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 10:38:22 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>and we could give sorcerers a self cast animate dead so they can walk to town themselves! 1x/day!</p></div></article><article id="post-569" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 10:59:02 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I think it's less of a death mechanic issue and more of a "the smaller races are hosed and probably don't get an equal benefit to balance the lack of strength" issue</p></div></article><article id="post-570" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">darconas</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 11:01:50 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli But this has zero effect on the smaller races - it has an effect on everyone else who encounters them.

I have to add the honestly part because generally more than half of what I say is purely for comedic effect, but that's why my disagreement is honest in this case.</p>

<p>From a mechanical standpoint, I would agree, but that's not the only standpoint in consideration for dragging and death for me. I look at death as an RP opportunity. With a captive audience that can't run away with me and can't go afk for fear of getting knocked offline! Bwahahaha. </p>

<p>I play a Burghal Gnome and generally can't drag anyone for anything, of course. And hey, I shouldn't be able to drag a Giantman mechanically. Yes, in this day and age of an overall meta game, suspension of disbelief wins, but I take it another direction. Occasionally I perform stand up comedy while calling on others to come help to drag or fog. More often than not I chastise the corpse about zigging when they should have zagged. Twice I've given demonstrations and valuable lectures on how to properly punch tiny ghosts, and every single time I consider releasing the ghost of the corpse in the name of Voln out loud. </p>

<p>I take the mechanical hindrance of my character and turn it into a fun experience for myself, and hopefully for the corpse involved. Doing everything on rapidfire mode gets old fast. </p>

<p>I think dragging is a perfect opportunity to slow down and smell the roses. It can be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>So I'm against making it easier to script or just otherwise "get out of the way" like we do with so many other aspects of the game these days.</p></div></article><article id="post-613" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Leafiara</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 2:14:44 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>After post cap goals were brought up at the roundtable, one of my first thoughts was that I hope they don't exclusively have offensive and defensive bonuses in mind. If there were a post cap goal where I could get a Strength bonus that applies to dragging bodies and has no other benefit--no AS boost, no encumbrance reduction, nothing else--I'd totally go for it because it fits the character I'm portraying.</p>

<p>I don't think it's a necessity or anything, though. I do like that fogging to a fallen adventurer and finding out they're a giant can be a real groan while finding out they're a halfling makes me grin.</p>

<p>By the way, regarding this...</p>

<p>RP can still be accomplished without restricting classes.  If your RP with a corpse is to entertain while someone more capable of rescue comes by, awesome - maybe you don't like touching corpses - whatever the case may be rescuing someone is not required.  However, if you can use the 305 spell to levitate a corpse (and only a corpse) making it more easy to transport, then great.  It also makes smaller race Clerics better at rescuing.</p></div></article><article id="post-696" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 4:57:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I do agree that a post-cap perk to make dragging easier, after it's earned, sounds reasonable.

Maybe do a hard build RT (like 3 minutes) or have it be something you can build in 20 RT that then gives a static 5 rt per move. Works over ice in Mule, but few other natural barriers.

<p>Edited to add:  I don't feel like there's a real need for this, honestly.  It's why field raises are a thing.  I live in Icemule primarily, and almost all the places people die, you can't drag them.  That's where Minor Sanct comes so powerfully into play, along with things like 130 and Voln Fog.

<p>Posh - give it to ranger companions, wizard familiars, spirit servants, etc.  Cat companions would leave claw marks (rank 1), wizard familiars would leave bite marks (rank 1, unless you really pissed the wizard off), spirit servants wouldn't leave any marks because - helpful, you see.
