<p>The first game for the thread is SteamWorld Dig which is free on Origin. It is an excellent game with a sequel soon to be released. You'll need to create an Origin account, but that is free.</p>

<p>https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/steamworld/steamworld-dig/standard-edition</p>

<p>This deal will only be available for a limited time and doesn't require you download the game, so i'd act sooner rather than later if this is something you're interested in playing.</p></div></article><article id="post-4498" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 11:44:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>https://archive.org/details/msdos<em>Oregon</em>Trail<em>Deluxe</em>The_1992</p>

<p>Kapow! Free online Nostalgia. Not the Apple IIe version, but still good.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, not totally free, but the humble monthly bundle is absolutely worth mentioning. It's $12 per month and every month they give you steam keys for $150-200 worth of games. I'm 3 months in and haven't been disappointed yet. </p>
