<p>Interesting!  Have you guys ever thought about polling the character databases and putting them up somewhere? Could be CRAZY nostalgia.</p>

<p>I'm imagining a searchable database for all characters > X years. For example... I remember having a goat pin and a really silly invasion hat from like 2000 and my first ever mithril shield. If I could actually search characters for those items and actually stumble upon him... Damn. That would be cool.</p>

<p>It would also make for a pretty cool email blast!</p></div></article><article id="post-1395" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 12:03:34 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You'd be surprised to know how many closed accounts we have.</p></div></article><article id="post-1397" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 12:04:07 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@wyrom said in <a href="/post/1385">Name Purge</a>:</p>

<p>I'm really not seeing the connection between name changes and encouraging character sales, unless you mean people will use the service to either misrepresent themselves or hide from their 'sold' reputation.</p>

<p>I just think that some of us would like the opportunity to take back poorly-chosen names that we thought up when we were kids.  Ex: one of my character's names is a semi-obscure villain from a '90s video game, but he's protected from badname because he's been around for so long.</p></div></article><article id="post-1478" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 3:00:09 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Selling names isn't something we would do.

<p>You're not buying levels.  You're buying a character (which is allowed on these boards), then buying a name change on top of that.  You're not creating a character out of nothing, the character is already there and for sale, and in any case, Simu would ostensibly be getting a 'cut' via the name change service.</p></div></article><article id="post-1482" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 3:39:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@taernath It depends on who you are and why you play. I've already level'd a character from scratch to mid 80's and I really don't want to experience that again, but after stumbling upon a great name and inspiration for RP around that name I started from scratch. </p>

<p>Therefore on a personal level, name changes would be advantageous for me since as soon as this service is provided I would purchase a capped or near capped character then delete my current main who's in his mid twenties and give the capped character my new name. I would be bypassing 5 to 6 years of play by doing this. </p>

<p>Again, personally name changes works for me and for you as well apparently. But thinking about the health of the game I just can't shake the fact that this would be like or similar to selling levels in a roundabout way. I'm just not sure. But, I'm certain Wyrom and Staff would have already figured this out.  </p>

<p>By the way, anyone know what Wyrom's stance is officially on name changes?</p></div></article><article id="post-1483" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Khariz</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 3:48:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If I could change my name...I might add the "i" into it.

<p>Not that it matters, but I actually like it without the "i".
