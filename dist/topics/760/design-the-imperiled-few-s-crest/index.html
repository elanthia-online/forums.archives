This crest can take almost any form, though it cannot hold other items. It can be given a long base or a show description. </p>

<p>Please post your idea to the thread no later than ~~Sunday~~ MONDAY at 11:59 PM EST. I'll select the winner either Monday or Tuesday. The winning entry will receive 1 million silver. Any are welcome to participate, but strong preference will be made for those participating in the HARDCORE contest. If you see an entry you like, call it out and it will be given increased consideration.</p></div></article><article id="post-8237" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Claudaro</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 12th, 2018, 7:45:38 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>A pair of crossed black iron blades against a polished brass shield insignia.</p>

<p>The idea being that the black blades represent death, which is being warded off by the shield.  The metal choices are three fold, first, the shield being brass since it is generally seen as a "tough" material in the sayings, having the brass,ect.  This is referencing having that brass to take on this challenge.  Second, iron has many many references and is seen as unyielding, which the constant threat of death in this challenge does exist.  Third, by making it two common, non-magical mundane metals, it signifies that belief that the supernatural, or magic, doesn't come into play for this group, and the belief that once one dies, that is the end, nothing can save you.</p>

<p>So you have the constant threat of death clashing with the fortitude and will of those fighting for their lives, just my take on it.</p></div></article><article id="post-8238" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Revial</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 12th, 2018, 7:50:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p><img src="https://imgur.com/Y2spE1p.jpg" alt="My Submission" title="" /></p></div></article><article id="post-8245" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, January 13th, 2018, 7:46:30 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@revial said in <a href="/post/8238">Design The Imperiled Few&apos;s Crest</a>:</p>

<p>It's unfortunate but I'm simply incapable of making a decent description.  If someone else wants to use this as a base though, I am completely and absolutely comfortable with that.</p></div></article><article id="post-8262" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, January 14th, 2018, 7:55:29 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I am going to extend the deadline to 11:59 PM EST Monday as I have the day off and won't be working on much until Tuesday.</p></div></article><article id="post-8263" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">BriarFox</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, January 14th, 2018, 9:35:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>A common brass badge engraved with a one-legged figure hopping along a precipice. ;)</p></div></article><article id="post-8266" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, January 15th, 2018, 12:18:18 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@briarfox said in <a href="/post/8263">Design The Imperiled Few&apos;s Crest</a>:</p>
