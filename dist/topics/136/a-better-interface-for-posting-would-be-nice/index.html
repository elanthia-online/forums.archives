<ul>
<li>While I like the easier to use bullet point method, placing the next line after a single carriage return just puts it inline with the same bullet point.
Like this sentence here.</li>
</ul>

<p>It takes 2 carriage returns to escape from it instead of just starting the next sentence one line lower down like it logically should with a single carriage return.</p>

<p>[table]thing one | Thing 2
3 | 4[/table]</p>

<p>So... how exactly would one go about making tables using this interface?  Nothing showing or stating how that would be done either.  (Also again with the single carriage return not generating a new line when I placed it following the '2' in that table attempt...)</p></div></article><article id="post-1017" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kalros</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 8:22:43 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@durakar </p>

<p>Ok, so this is a completely tagless system...  super confusing without a guide of some kind to someone not familiar with using <em>, <strong>, *?</em>, ^%#</strong>^(% or whatever other oddball things to get the various results I want.  </p>

<p>Why the move away from functional, understandable, and intuitive html tags?</p></div></article><article id="post-1020" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Doug</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 8:25:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@durakar Markdown is such a . . . pleasure . . . to learn.</p>

<p>You don't really need two carriage returns. <br />
A new line can be forced by two periods after then period. <br />
Then you can get a series of single liners together like this.  </p>

<p>Tables are fun!  At least, I think that's the word.  Here's a template from https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.</p>

<p>```Colons can be used to align columns.</p>

<p>| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |

<p>Okay to elaborate a bit... I've spent a few hours poking around trying to figure out just what "this" is.</p>

<p>The forums is nodeBB.  The language is "markdown."  Markdown language enables easy communication across all the platforms (because they use different carriage returns etc etc.) It's actually VERY popular so there is ton's of things to google.  For example, when i saw your question i googled "markdown language tables" and found this table generator tool located here.</p>

<p>http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables</p>

<p>Basically tons and tons of stuff to google and get familiar with.</p></div></article><article id="post-1022" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Durakar</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 8:26:22 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@kalros said in <a href="/post/1021">A better interface for posting would be nice</a>:</p>

<p>I think mega-colors and rainbows are out of date an non-functional.</p>

<p>I believe they are working on colors though.</p>

<p>HTML is also a security risk which is why it's disabled.</p></div></article><article id="post-1096" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 10:03:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>this might be interesting and useful.
