Has to be the same slot.  Can be swapped to item with or without enhansives already.  If the piece has enhansives already you can overwrite them or add to it, but to maximum of 2 slots.  The item would have the charges of the swapped enhansive, not what was already on the item.</p>

<p>Maybe this service already exists but I can't remember seeing it.</p>
