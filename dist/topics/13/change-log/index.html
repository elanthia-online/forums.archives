<h4>usage</h4>

<ol>
<li>navigate to <code>&lt;user profile for person you want to ignore&gt;</code> </li>
<li><code>&gt; More &gt; Ignore User | Ignore Chats</code> </li>
<li>Profit?</li>
</ol>

<p>changes may take a second for this particular plugin to propogate through to your settings since it's possible to ignore a large body of content.</p>

<p>it still shows that a person you ignored posted something, just not what they said.</p>

<p>They will no longer be able to send you PMs at all if you ignore chats from them.</p>

<p>Alright... If I said that we were ecstatic that you've all been interested in them, enjoying them, and whatnot, that would be an astronomical understatement.  </p>

<p>However, that being said... we're curbing creation/privacy of groups.  The original intent was things like MHOs, CHEs, blahblahblah.  With some exception for organizations like, Mentors, Newsby folks, Wiki mods, and other GS Stuff, most of those ancillary groups have been created.</p>

<p>Seems like people are using them for custom titles, which was not the intent.  I'll eventually be scrubbing them, reconciling with MHO/CHE listings and whatnots, and getting to them.  But for now, we've turned off group creation.</p>

<p>Please reach out to one of us admin folks if we missed a group that should be created.  Or reach out to multiple ones and one of us will take care of it.</p></div></article><article id="post-1712" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 9:56:27 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I fixed category (folder) permissions per Durakar's thread.  It has to do with this new template.  All categories should now be clickable to see their components and most recent posts/threads within them.  Watch, unwatch, whatever them... Or don't.  That's cool too.</p>

<p>Also a few other categories got hidden in the transition too.  That's hopefully been fixed, but we'll see.</p></div></article><article id="post-1746" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 2:51:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>ignore users is back up, you should not have lost any settings</p></div></article><article id="post-4571" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 5:01:25 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>disabled images in signatures.</p></div></article><article id="post-5018" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 13th, 2017, 9:37:56 AM</div></div><div class="content"><h3>about those signature images...</h3>

<p>I've been getting reports this change did not work as expected and went down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>There is apparently a bug at work with how one of the plugins interacts with signatures or something that overrides the <code>allow images in signatures</code> admin options.  I don't really have the time or desired to solve it properly (figure out where the conflict is and open a pr to fix it) for now.</p>

<p>instead, I manually killed all image displaying in signatures forever.</p>

<p>if you're still seeing them, maybe clear your cache.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
