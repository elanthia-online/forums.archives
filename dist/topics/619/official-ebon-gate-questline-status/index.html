<p>The quest reward item is not yet available.</p>

<p>I plan to kick off the finale either tonight or tomorrow night. I haven't decided! Obviously, I would like for lots to be around. It does not matter where you are when this kicks off - everyone on Caligos Isle will experience it, but it may be different in one location versus another.</p>

<p>In addition, the item's benefit will not kick in until after Ebon Gate has ended.</p>

<p>Quest item is a progressive item for the next 4 years.  At its base, it is a zested item (which will also increase in verb traps); If you have the max 1000 favor, then you have access to a POINT ability which (currently) is -5DS/-3TD, 3x/day.  That will increase both in strength and usage.  If you are a convert (and at max favor) you also have the COVER ability which is a fear resistance boost.  That will increase both in strength and usage, as well.</p>

<p>You can PROD the item to change the item type (bracelet, ring, anklet, and... I forget if pendant is in there or not.)</p>

<p>There will be an opportunity to "catch up" at EG18.
(and at subsequent years)</p>

<p>It won't happen before EG18 though.
It will always be more beneficial to do it when it's first available, rather than catching up on the back end.</p></div></article><article id="post-7051" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 30th, 2017, 2:49:59 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@evarin </p>

<p>You done effed up son. Nobody else uses the term "player2player" except for, you guessed it, Macgyver. Here are the only two usages of that term on the "other board", and they are both from your troll accounts:</p>

<p>So this Macguyver is apparently a troll on the PC and uses the term "player2player" and since I use the term as well I'm this Macguyver person? Uh, circumstantial much?</p>

<p>Try doing a google search of "player2player" exactly, that's right you get over 200,000 results. </p>

<p>Mogonis, I really don't understand why you had a beef with me advocating a buff of the quest item, I wasn't the only one. And apparently, Haliste did buff it a bit. I feel for your losses, but the event isn't over yet and there's still a ton of jackpots out there. Good luck and have fun!</p></div></article><article id="post-7058" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 30th, 2017, 6:13:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@god said in <a href="/post/7057">Official: Ebon Gate Questline Status</a>:</p>

<p>What are you talking about? My losses? You didn't advocate the quest item. You called it useless.</p></div></article><article id="post-7064" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 30th, 2017, 9:47:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@mogonis Get some sleep bud.

<p>Just to clarify here so that there's no confusion, I never <em>buffed</em> the item.  I added the ability for players to change the worn location, but the mechanical benefits now are the same as they were when the item was originally created.</p></div></article><article id="post-7086" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, October 31st, 2017, 8:03:30 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@haliste </p>

<p>Fair enough. Quick question though, why the massive disparity in power between last year's Quest item and this year? Even at the start Heroism or Cloak of Shadows x3 times a day (ultimately x5) at 1 hour a piece is enormous versus -3 TD on one creature x3 a day.. which feels very token.</p>

<p>Will there be more unique unlocks in the coming EG's for the item, you know, more than just a straight up -3 TD or an extra x1 per day? I would gladly pay $50+ in simucoins just for more selection on the unlocks alone (on top of entry fees into the games portion of EG).</p></div></article><article id="post-7089" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Candor</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, October 31st, 2017, 9:44:26 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>uh...how do I get my quest item?

<p>That's the plan, but since we're <em>just</em> now ending EG17, I have no plans to discuss it further at this time. A lot can happen in 11 months.</p></div></article><article id="post-7107" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, October 31st, 2017, 4:20:27 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I love that your icon is a venti pony.
