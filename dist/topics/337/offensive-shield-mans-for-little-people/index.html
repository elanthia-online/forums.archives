You can sometimes get away with trample if you pick the shortest thing in the room but in general I'd stick with passive maneuvers. I'm a big fan of all things halfling but I would not pick halfling as a shield warrior intent on using the offensive maneuvers.</p></div></article><article id="post-3333" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 4:06:16 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@spiffyjr Great, thanks for the advice. I'm only dabbling with shorter races currently. I wonder if the shorter races have any distinct shield man advantages to offset for their lack of offensive capability.</p></div></article><article id="post-3343" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">SpiffyJr</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 5:02:29 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Nope, I personally think shields are kinda poop on small races <strong>unless</strong> you pick them up purely for defense. A shield/polearm using warrior is quite awesome as you can still reach the eyes of a lot of things. That said, trample can work if you pick your initial target well.</p></div></article><article id="post-3347" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 5:38:48 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@spiffyjr So, gotta be very tactical. You would think a small race would benefit more from coverage as obviously a tower shield would protect more of you.</p></div></article><article id="post-3349" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 6:03:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@spiffyjr </p>

Lots of mstrike and big ass weapons (or UAC). I'm almost 65 and picked up 2 MoC enhancive ranks so my UAC will hit 5 times. I've had no problems so far just destroying shit before it can attack me. In Gemstone the best defense is a punch of punches to the face!</p></div></article><article id="post-3358" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 7:43:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@spiffyjr I'm slowly coming to the realization of how true this is, well I guess it's back to ye' ole perfect greatsword.</p></div></article><article id="post-3610" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 9:42:59 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This is a side question, I'm noticing my shield strikes sometimes hit the target but doesn't do any damage, roll was too, would a flare or spike from a shield go off in this instance?
