<p>You should be okay to just email to create the group, not invite. Once the group is created, there shouldn't be any restrictions keeping you from inviting whoever you want.</p></div></article><article id="post-3540" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 27th, 2017, 2:05:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Why was this change implemented?</p></div></article><article id="post-3542" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 27th, 2017, 3:01:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim said in <a href="/post/3540">Making Groups</a>:</p>

<p>Like you have "The Gypsy Troupe" after your name?  I'm assuming that's a real in game group, but people were creating fake groups to sort of give themselves a "title" to appear after their screen name here.</p></div></article><article id="post-3543" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 27th, 2017, 3:02:19 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Admin wanted group creation to be for CHE/MHO, but people started to make groups for fun.

<p>That's what it looks like.</p>

<p>If the name I picked was a problem, I could have easily changed it.</p>

<p>As always though, I will abide by the rules, no matter how loose they appear to be, and create a new group that complies.</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarification!</p></div></article><article id="post-3605" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 8:39:14 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@taernath said in <a href="/post/3596">Making Groups</a>:</p>

<p>If you read the post, it said it made an exception for Wiki Moderators and Mentors.  There were a few exceptions made in order to designate certain people to speak to directly involved in these aspects of the game.</p></div></article><article id="post-3606" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 8:41:04 AM</div></div><div class="content"><blockquote>

  GROUPS…</p>
  
  <p>Alright… If I said that we were ecstatic that you’ve all been interested in them, enjoying them, and whatnot, that would be an astronomical understatement.</p>
  
  <p>However, that being said… we’re curbing creation/privacy of groups. The original intent was things like MHOs, CHEs, blahblahblah. <em>With some exception for organizations like, Mentors, Newsby folks, Wiki mods, and other GS Stuff, most of those ancillary groups have been created.</em></p>
  
  <p>Seems like people are using them for custom titles, which was not the intent. I’ll eventually be scrubbing them, reconciling with MHO/CHE listings and whatnots, and getting to them. But for now, we’ve turned off group creation.</p>
  
  <p>Please reach out to one of us admin folks if we missed a group that should be created. Or reach out to multiple ones and one of us will take care of it.</p>

<p>For your reference.</p></div></article><article id="post-3634" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Parkbandit</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 12:00:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>That clears it up Maetriks!
