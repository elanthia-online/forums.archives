<p>I've got zero use for a bane on a weapon, and the deadline is SUNDAY, so I want someone to use it!</p>

<p>Auction will end Saturday 3pm Eastern time. I will honor timestamps in this thread <em>only</em>. No private bids, please.</p>

<p>Delivery to Ta'Illistim, Ta'Vaalor, FWI. Things are too hectic for me to promise to get to the Landing in a timely manner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Common language, it reads:
  This ticket entitles the bearer to ONE creature bane service on thier weapon.  RESTRICTIONS APPLY! (no katanas, claids, nothing over 7x and no undead bane or weighting)  This ticket expires at midnight on Restday, Imaerasta 10th as the elves tell time.  It can be redeemed in person during the Festival of the Fallen or by emailing gs4-Mazreth@play.net.  If I have not received an email by the expiration date, the service is forfeit.</p>

<p>The charts have incorrect information but the top section is updated recently by GM Finros on what can go on what.  Creature bane should be compatible with almost anything according to Finros.</p>

<p>It is under Category C which states.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any number may be present; magnitude may vary in some cases; may be temporary or permanent in some cases
  Creature Bane items may grant damage/critical padding/weighting or flares, separate from anything in Category B. Only one Creature Bane foe type and one Creature Bane effect may be present.</p>

<p>The no flares no combat scripts have been a restriction for a long time, so it's safe to assume that this ticket probably has that restriction.  Heck, that's probably why it was forgotten (not an excuse), it's become so normal to the GM's they don't even think to mention it.</p>

<p>Honestly, they need to start stating these things as "the following are allowed" rather than "no."  The universe is just too big to remember everything each time.</p>

<p>Pretty sure its this:  The following are Allowed - Enchantments up to 7x, Ensorcelling.  Natural properties apply.</p></div></article><article id="post-4670" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rozy</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 9:34:30 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>1.5m</p></div></article><article id="post-4674" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">JNewhall</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 9:44:50 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>3 Million</p></div></article><article id="post-4675" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 9:44:58 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>5m</p></div></article><article id="post-4679" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rozy</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 9:52:39 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>6m</p></div></article><article id="post-4680" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 9:54:25 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>8m</p></div></article><article id="post-4681" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 9:54:59 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Stop driving the price up for when I snipe you!</p></div></article><article id="post-4683" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 9:57:48 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>10m</p></div></article><article id="post-4684" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 10:03:41 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>12m</p></div></article><article id="post-4685" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 10:04:46 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>15</p></div></article><article id="post-4686" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 10:05:26 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>A shame you can't add weighting with this</p></div></article><article id="post-4689" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 10:34:11 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@vishra Why?

<p>Previous winners of bane at THIS venue were unable to add weighting as their bane property, and could only add flares or AS increase.  I don't think there's been any indication that you could not later add non-bane related weighting.</p>

<p>Overall, it sounds like the crux of the issue here is that Events GM's are dealing with a service that's normally only handled by combat GM's, so didn't know to specify what sub-properties etc.</p></div></article><article id="post-4693" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 10:40:11 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex Damnit I misunderstood the comment again.

<p>Based on what's been shared, it's both.  The weapon must be very plain, and can get AS or Flare Banes added, if it's similar to the raffle.  no reason to think it isn't.  Still a nice thing, but it's the first step of an item, rather than being adding banes to finish a project off.</p></div></article><article id="post-4708" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ashraam VanEyre</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 1:57:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If you added bonus AS extraplanar bane to a 7x weapon, would that qualify it to strike demons since I believe all demons are extraplanar creatures, and the weapon bonus after the Bane would exceed 8x (assuming you also had the weapon blessed)?</p></div></article><article id="post-4709" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 2:01:33 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I believe so yes.

<p>No, "Creature Bane" is not a type of bane.  It's the general term for they overall property.

<p>I disagree, there are definite distinctions. See the mana and acuity pages. the common/uncommon/rare is pretty solidly consistent in merchant services.</p>

<p>a big problem on that page is there are so many non-standard flares listed and they need to be separated</p></div></article><article id="post-4762" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 6:41:23 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I used to be under the impression the vacuum was uncommon, but its also listed as common now, did the two (acid and vacuum) just switch?</p></div></article><article id="post-4763" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 6:43:26 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim said in <a href="/post/4762">Jackpot Win: Creature Bane Ticket</a>:</p>
