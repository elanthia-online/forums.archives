<p>I cleaned up some issues with the fishbowls that were available on the Spitfire and are for sale in the Eastern Harbor. You can now INSPECT them and get some useful information. I also added analyze information with verbs and alteration guidelines.</p>

<p>There were previously no alteration instructions on these fishbowls, so if you have one that looks a little wonky, please ASSIST to have it looked at.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure we didn't talk directly (so it's probable you talked to Vanah?), but the bug went to me for fixing ;) That definitely was a few years back! But glad it makes better sense now.</p>

<p>FWIW, the globes aren't alterable for a few reasons -- changing the base's adjective will essentially break the item (i.e. the traps won't work). And the LOOK is hard-coded, so any custom show description wouldn't show up (plus it'd be super easy to start conflicting with all of the descriptors in the verb traps). If it's a long description alteration you're after, that's a possibility -- just let me know if that's what you had in mind.</p>

<p>There is not a Makiri globe currently -- just Elanthia, Lornon, Liabo, Tilaok, and a general "celestial" globe. If you have thoughts on what a Makiri one should/would look like and how it would message with the verb traps, definitely feel free to email me!</p>

<p>Premium Homes are a largely unmaintained legacy system at this point. I don't have anyone code-cleared to take on the system or do much of anything with it right now. It has killed multiple GMs in the past so I'm not going to force that on anyone.</p>

<p>There is no automatic eviction set up like player shops have. From what I've seen in my cursory examination of the system, it would require someone with a decent working knowledge of the home system to go through each room in each neighborhood and manually check each home against the account's status. The system was built well before we could do decent automation like we can now.</p>

<p>Premium homes cannot be freed up if the owner is an active subscriber. There is then a grace period you have after you deactivate your account where you can get your home back.</p>

<p>Automatic evictions have been turned off for over 10 years. The former SGM that oversaw the Premium and Platinum teams ended up freeing up homes a long time ago (again, over 10 years ago), but it looks like that caused bugs that the system still hasn't recovered from to this day.</p>

<p>A house count from 2004 isn't something we could honor 13 years later. I don't see there being more homes in the last 10 years, so it's difficult to know what might have happened.</p>

<p>We'll investigate it more, but upper class homes were always intended to be very limited and more expensive.</p>

  <p>Just to clarify, while a lot of us tend to view GMs as volunteers, companies can't use volunteer labor (AKA unpaid labor). That's violation of FLSA. There are some very limited exceptions, but working on a core product wouldn't be one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GameMasters aren't volunteers. They are independent contractors that take on a project load. We separate project types by team. They have a time frame to complete projects, but they can do it on their own schedule and typically we offer extensions where we can. Events are very time sensitive and more demanding. We have a specific team that works on events. There isn't a lot of compensation, but we're pretty upfront with that from the get go. GMs who do more make more. We do something called profit sharing, commonly referred to as shares. GMs make a percent of the revenue that gets shared in a pool based on their contributions. We also have some benefits for GameMasters who still enjoy playing.</p>

Greater is permablessed in that it can always hit undead, a bless strengthens the effects. Lesser cannot hit undead without a bless, but is capable of having 2 flares when hitting the undead. Lesser Bane first went out in the form of vials in a past DR run, and the first weapon with the permanent version of the flare went out as an EG jackpot pull (a golvern maul).</p>

<p>Estild via the Discord:</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 12:59 AM There's lesser and greater undead bane.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 1:10 AM You must get it blessed to hit the undead.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 1:12 AM Lesser undead bane potions went out a DR run or two ago.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 1:13 AM It can have 2 flares against the undead.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 1:13 AM No. It can does not mean it does. You can get normal flares added to it. (Well, depending on which slot you're referring to the holy water flare in, ArchSenex)</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 1:14 AM The maul has a flare that will trigger in addition to any other normal weapon abilities when used against the undead.</p>

<p>ArchSenex - Today at 1:15 AM ok, so with an appropriate bless, it should get the double flares (against undead) since the holy water flares I believe enter the standard flare slot while the weapon is blessed</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 1:15 AM Correct.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 1:17 AM They are exactly the same, except greater doesn't require a bless to affect the undead while lesser does.(edited)</p></div></article><article id="post-7287" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, November 7th, 2017, 8:56:15 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Quote from GM Haliste on the Officials regarding the number of Ghezresh converts:</p>

Note that the log was edited for clarity.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 3:32 PM
Just in case it wasn't clear, I was joking about the 11, mainly because giving creatures 0 seconds of RT would result in nothing. It would not "tag" creatures for credit.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 3:49 PM
Yes, if 909 knocks down the target, it would result in credit. But I suspect this request was made because other characters are using 410, which means the targets are already prone and thus not affected by 909's knock down.(edited)</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 3:53 PM
RT itself does not give any credit. It appears that way with 709, but that's because it's still giving credit as if the target was knocked down even if the target was already on the ground. It was actually a bug, as noted by my comment at SimuCon, but we decided to let it be.(edited)</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:06 PM
909 will still apply the EBP penalty (assuming success on the skill check) regardless if target is already prone or not, but EBP penalties do not grant credit.(edited)</p>

<p>Ragz - Today at 4:21 PM
Is there any skill in the game that induces RT that doesn't give tag credit?</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:23 PM
For the most part no, since most abilities that induce RT also do other effects that do grant credit. But there are edge cases like with 504.</p>

<p>Ragz - Today at 4:24 PM
Doesn't 504 award tag credit?</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:25 PM
No.</p>

<p>Ragz - Today at 4:25 PM
Is there a game balance reason we couldn't allow 909 to award tag credit?</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:27 PM
Yes, since the reason players want tag credit is usually in the scenarios where there is very little risk.</p>

<p>Ragz - Today at 4:31 PM
What is the trivial part anyway? I mean you're getting 1/10th of the xp. Could we reduce that to 0xp in favor of allowing the tag?</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:32 PM
It's more than just experience. e.g. it was never intended that sorcerers would easily max out their weekly gains of necrotic energy the way that it is being done now.</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:34 PM
We could make such combat more difficult, but I imagine most of you wouldn't like that. So things will probably stay as they are, but that also means we're not going to make it easier.</p>

<p>A⌋å§†ìℜ �� - Today at 4:34 PM
Not make combat easier, or not make getting tag credit easier?</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:34 PM
Well, both, but the latter specifically.(edited)</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:40 PM
It already is too easy, regardless of if we change 909 or not.(edited)</p>

<p>Estild - Today at 4:41 PM
Like I said, it's not a matter of creating a challenge. We could certainly do that. But I'm willing to bet there would be a good number of people who would not like that.</p></div></article><article id="post-7407" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 9th, 2017, 11:33:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Quote from GM Kynlee:</p>

<p>I just tested it and it appears to be working fine. However, previously, there was no messaging to know when it kicked in (you had to type SPELL ACTIVE) to see if the Recovery debuff was listed or not. I added new messaging when Rapid Fire (515) is cast to note when the Elemental Lore, Water benefit kicks in.</p>

<p>Banes can't be automated. But other banes can certainly be discussed. What banes would people like to see? Be very specific (even if you don't think it exists). The 8 points of weighting or flares was something we tried, but banes aren't limited to those numbers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is because bloodscrip are already established. As I've mentioned in another thread (EG), I'm a stickler for keeping to story. Bloodscrip, while is just a currency, is linked to Bloodriven Village. I wouldn't want to use it at another venue. We could create another type of event at Bloodriven Village, sure.</p>

<p>Enhancive work is something for Summit Academy. We want to give Summit Academy specific goals. Greater moods, same issues, it's all custom work so it's not a very good venue. Weight reduction at a lower price point, would you just want to buy 1% at a time? Or do you mean it's too pricey at 5%? It sells quite a bit at its current price point, so it would be tough to move it.</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>Just a quick note about some minor adjustments on the Ritual Daggers:</p>

<p>(1) Previously on the Tier 2 daggers, you could only change your "grip" when it was held in the right hand; that is no longer true -- you can now do so in either hand.</p>

<p>(2) On the Tier 2+ daggers that have the ability to toggle between flavors (this is just a handful of you that have this) -- flavor-toggling is no longer done via CLENCH (due to the above update). Instead, you will need to ATTEND -- either hand -- to toggle the flavor.</p>

<p>(3) Tier 2 and 2+ daggers that are set up as Arkati or custom flavors -- for scarring via POINT, you should be able to toggle the preposition and the location now (see the ANALYZE if you're not sure how to do that) in the same way that the 'default' flavor allows. If your dagger is a custom flavor, you can toggle through the various locations/prepositions to use your customized description on now -- however, if you want to use your custom location/preposition, those are set up as a bundle -- just toggle to that custom location of yours, and it'll handle both the preposition+location; just toggle the location back to any default option and you can toggle the prepositions per usual.</p>

<p>(4) For Tier 2 and 2+ daggers, when you LOOK at your dagger when it is in-hand, when applicable it will now indicate what grip you're using &amp; what flavor (if you are able to toggle between them) it's set to.</p>

<p>A few of you are waiting on your customizations still; I'll be touching base with you over the next few days if you haven't already heard from me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I actually didn't realize the spell messaging was changed so that only the caster sees, but in RP events, it is brutal for me to try to see what's going on in the middle of sometimes several screens worth of spells being tacked on to others then the spells dropping. I can squelch it, I can use a lich script to mitigate it, but it sometimes does cause a slowdown on my end, plus I can miss things. Personally, I would prefer a hard toggle like a flag setting, but even if the group version was changed to an evoke or channel, it would be helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're aware that players are currently unhappy with the volume of messaging that they're exposed to. Spell fade messaging is rooted in the current base design of spells, so there isn't a quick fix to eliminate it without going through each problem spell one by one. We also don't just want to rip out all fade messing as that would probably cause more problems than it fixes.</p>

<p>It helps to know the specific spells that are the biggest offenders for individual reviews. I was constantly seeing complaints about "group spells" being the offenders, even after I restricted the spell application + fade messaging to casters and targets. Now that I know the current offenders are the 2 minute group applications of single cast spells that people unlock with lore benefits I can look towards the right locations for potential solutions.</p>

<p>SGM Galene and I just spoke about a similar subject a week ago when it comes to the time line needed for CHE/MHO prep. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with the current setup that was put in place. One thing we've tried to overcome in the last 3 years is to modernize the game and offer less time constraints to both players and staff. MHO/CHE event policies are something we need to tackle in the near future.</p>

<p>The great thing about GemStone IV is we will support and allow player-run events as much as we can. But there are dozens of active MHOs/CHEs running events. It makes up the majority of our calendar these days. Look at today, for example. The majority of the evening is just player-run events. That's a big stretch of time. We also offer MHOs/CHEs a lot more tools and privileges nowadays like running raffles, having prize closets with scripted items, and around the clock support.</p>

<p>We also have over fifty staff members, with more than half being CE GMs. Those CE GMs have monthly projects that involve working with players in some capacity. Staff are not forced into a schedule due to their independent contractor status. They work on their own schedule, but we do try as hard as we can to avoid overlap. When it comes to overlap, we do ask GMs to try to schedule during our more congested population times. We also ask to try to start at either the top of the hour or within 30 minutes intervals. So in cases where a player raffle draws as the same time as a GM raffle, it will be a lot more common if it's at X:00 or X:30. GMs won't stagger things into X:05 or X:10.</p>

<p>As for pay events, dates and times are only tentative until about 30 days before they run. SGM Haliste and I plan to try to do better with that time table, but not all of it is within our control. Pay events are guaranteed the months of February, April, June, August, October, and December. </p>

<p>Like everything, nothing is perfect. We do as best as we can, as well as continually offer more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know what genius decided to make the penalties for ruic, but they were an evil genius. -60 penalty to enchant. >></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hello! The attributes of materials are generally tied into the lore backing that material. When I assigned the enchanting difficulties for materials, I primarily considered the properties and descriptions from the materials document with some consideration for any history or reputation a particular material may have held. Ruic has some interesting magical flavor that excludes its use as a material for rune staves</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mossbark has a 0, and is +15...too much trouble to make mossbark bows with an extra enchant though for off the shelf merchant items (despite 4x mithril fusion shields as an example). >></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us turn this idea around: why not buy the mossbark bow at +15 and slap that extra +5 on it yourself? It is a minor enchantment project, so it should be of trivial concern and relatively minor time investment. I like to sell "pre-enchanted" stuff in my shops on occasion, but I typically do not do so because I want wizards (and low level characters) to have options, either for direct use or for enchanting as minor projects (some wizards do lots of minor projects.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like I said, please do something about this. >></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we could review the enchanting difficulty for materials in certain contexts. It is worth pointing out that the Ranged Weapons style of combat is the only style of combat that allows a player to trivially obtain the equivalent of +50/10x gear. Enchanting a bow up to +30 is more significant than enchanting, say, a longsword to the same level. Perhaps in a comprehensive review of an enchanting system, we can reconsider ALL of these aspects and how appropriate they are in today's Elanthia.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I assume you're both comparing the difference from a non-node to a guild workshop. If you compare the number to a node vs. a guild workshop, you should be able to get the determine the actual number. This is really getting into semantics, but being on a node doesn't provide a bonus, instead it actually prevents a penalty (for not being on a node). Not a huge issue, but if you do incorporate the non-penalty into the guild workshop bonus, it also needs to be incorporated into the public and private workshop bonuses. But when I said the private workshop bonus is twice as effective as the public workshop bonus, I was not including the negation of the non-node penalty.</p>

<hr />

<p>So the likely numbers are likely as PeregrineFalcon suggested in a subsequent post:</p>

<p>Not on a node: -40
Earthnode: 0
Public Workshop: 40
Wizard Guild Workshop: 60
Private Workshop: 80</p>

<p>If you have a 10x broadsword, the cost for a single service might be 318k. You could either decline to use the win on that item or make up the difference of 218k for a single service. This one service would be the only service you would receive.</p>

<p>In reviewing this, I discovered a bug where the Spirit Mana Control benefit was not being applied. It should now be fixed. Such training can have a dramatic effect upon the severity of the nausea.</p>

<p>Yes there are a formulas that uses bezoars. I do not see any reason why they couldn't be learned through the library.</p>

<p>BRANDTJRT has provided a clue to what they may be used for. <grin> (His post here: http://forums.play.net/forums/GemStone%20IV/Magic%20Spells%60Systems/Alchemy%20Discussions/view/966)</p>

<p>One thing to note, is that the color of the bezoar is what is important and not the creature it comes from.</p>

<p>I just applied a change to this script so that when a gem with "uncut" as the adjective is used in the box, the adjective for the box-style will replace the "uncut" adjective on the gem. This is the only time the style will replace the adjective. All other "cut" gems will have the style applied to the article of the gem.</p>
