<p>What makes sense are maneuvers that are automatically learned when you have ranks in a weapon type. TRIP is a good example. If there were 1 or more per weapon type that got stronger the more ranks of the weapon you have, that'd be a great boon for warriors.</p>

<p>Have CM allow you to use the weapon class specific ones with other weapon types (when appropriate) on a sliding scale of lessening penalties, and there you go. Lots of new toys for Squares/Semis, with Warriors receiving arguably the most benefit.</p></div></article><article id="post-1056" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 9:11:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@evarin I'm half joking, I would like to see lower costs for cman ranks on pure classes.

<p>They'd be so PTP starved it'd take them ages to round out their build anyway. 1x MIU/Arcane symbols is also huge for warriors post-cap. Magical ranks in general helps with spellburst.</p>

<p>Correct. It'd be capped by only having 1 sister skill by weapon type, but yes. That's the idea.</p>

<p>Warriors, along with other Squares, get screwed over in that they don't have the equivalent of 3x spells (2x for semis) at cap.

<p>Oh, yes. Berserks definitely need a little love at master. Things like stopping a little earlier as you said, or.. say even if we can't get a prioritizing mstrike, berserk mastery allows for attempting to specify a target for, say, a %success chance at extra stamina cost per attempt.. opening us up to focus mstrike mid-berserk for a price.</p>

  <p>It's a rough solution but it might be easier to implement. Give warriors an ability that can be triggered in berserk that does nothing but drain all your stamina. Effectively ending your berserk run.</p>
  
  <p>It totally screws you in a lot of situations, but choices must be made!</p>
  
  <p>Stamina burst/second wind could help in the after effects. It would also be really cool if STAMINA SECOND WIND could include +1 stamina so it was viable when you had 0 stamina. It is a scind wind after all!</p>

<p>Since almost the beginning of time, I've asked for an ability to end a berserk early at the cost of ending your hunt. First, blowing your nerves. Then at the cost of blowing your nerves and popping your muscles (once that was a thing). Then as a daily power once pures started getting those. Maybe some day.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
