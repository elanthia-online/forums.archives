<p>Unlike vBulletin, NodeBB is designed to run more seamlessly on mobile devices using your mobile browsers' capability.  Easier than a billion more stand alone applications running on your phone.</p>

<p>That being said, I know Luxie was having a lot of problems with some mobile formatting on iOS devices, which we can manage through template manipulation efforts that we have ongoing. </p>

<p>Additionally, it looks like we can enable push notifications to your mobile device using Pushbullet as an intermediary API.  If this is something that people are interested in (receiving push notifications from forums sounds terrible) we can add it to the backlog.</p></div></article><article id="post-913" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 12:50:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/912">App?</a>:</p>

<p>I think push notifications would be good on threads we'd be watching, like if we're running a sales thread and want to keep an eye on it.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
