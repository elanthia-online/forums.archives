I know the powers that be said that they wanted to keep it vague so it couldn't be abused but the fact is I am getting SCREWED constantly by this mechanic.</p>

<p>ALL of my gems and loot are self found. All of them. Yet whenever I do a big sell off I get 0% bonus from either my trading, inf, or citizenship. Clearly something is happening to flag my loot.</p>

<p>I will be looking into the matter as best I can, and looking into a couple issues.</p>

<p>A: Is the "week" based on lumnis</p>

<p>B: Does the toon killing/looting/picking up have a bearing on the "self loot" flag</p>

<p>C: Does storing items in jars, lockers, or with a mule cause them to become "not self-loot"</p>

<p>I am currently getting 0% bonus (verified by equal offers in Mule and Landing) and my lumnis will be resetting in 12 hours so I should be able to test the lumnis week at least.</p></div></article><article id="post-1721" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 11:18:05 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The adjustment was only for characters selling treasure that another character generated.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to log and prove this other than by taking the steps I mentioned and determining when I get the bonus refreshed, then focusing my hunting/looting/storage for that week to see what causes it to disappear. </p>

<p>My gut assumes either jarring is the issue, or the killing blow dictates loot so when I hunt with a group and do all looting and loot split I am cutting into my bonus.</p></div></article><article id="post-1724" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 11:31:10 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I didn't say it wasn't, I gave you the methods to get it properly reported.</p></div></article><article id="post-1725" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 11:35:18 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You said, and I agree, I should get better details than just "where my bonus at?".

<p>I wish it were that easy! As I understand the change, you can sell 1M in "non-self generated loot" before your entire bonus (trading+citizenship) is removed for ALL loot. So after finding the start point I will need to do 1M in specific loot to see if I lose the bonus :(</p>

<p>But I agree with the joy of discovery! This is not stickiest quagmire I have waded into!</p></div></article><article id="post-1729" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">rolfard</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 1:37:26 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Kill something.

<p>The trade bonus will only turn off after 1M in "bad" sales. I won't be able to see a difference in any individual gem until I cross that threshold.  I am checking bonus by price checking in Mule and Wehnimer's. If the prices match, I am getting 0 bonus.</p></div></article><article id="post-1732" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ragz</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 1:53:16 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ososis If you're really looking to do some experimentation you can sell gem sacks from HoA's Reim run tonight, ~9:45-10pm est is when we'll have the sacks ready to go.

<p>Oh that's a GREAT idea! I could utilize the Reim hunt to test out some theories in short order instead of having to do it myself over the week. That would save me from having to compartmentalizing the different aspects of my game play that may have an effect, and doing only THAT till I get 1M in loot.</p>

<p>Assuming it will reset on lumnis I won't be ready today.</p></div></article><article id="post-1849" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Gizmo</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 12:13:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This brings a question to my head, being new to Bards still to this day as they are one of the few professions I never bothered reading up on...</p>

<p>buying gems from others should be considered "bad" loot and add to your 1M bonus total. I haven't played with this (or anything since my boost has yet to refresh) but that is my assumption.</p>

<p>Current working ideas on reset is</p>

<p>A:1 week from when you first sell "bad" loot</p>

<p>B:1 week from when you hit your 1M limit.</p></div></article><article id="post-1899" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Lochiven</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 5:44:09 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What race is your character Ososis?</p></div></article><article id="post-1913" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 7:00:59 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@lochiven giantfolk.

You are giantkin and I assume a citizen of Icemule.  Your appraisals in Landing and Icemule come up with the same value which leads you to believe you aren't benefiting from trade skill+INF(racial modifier of 0 in each city).  For science sake, have another character with a 0 racial modifier and the same trading % as you appraise.  I think you're assuming you get a citizenship bonus and because landing/icemule gives same value you think you are penalized.  Someone about a year ago posted a handful of times on the officials about a citizenship bonus for selling being turned off and it was met with a little discussion but mostly crickets, and certainly no official word.  I also had always assumed you got 5% for selling in your own city, after his/her post I went and confirmed with my human and half elf citizens in solhaven with equal trading bonus.  I then confirmed in landing with my citizen/non citizen half elves.</p></div></article><article id="post-1918" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 7:22:10 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@lochiven </p>

<p>As far as I know, only what was said in that thread where Whirlin first brought the stealth nerf to light. Someone else chimed in during the thread to say it also applies to self-found loot after a certain point, but I don't know where he got that information. Not saying he's wrong, just that I can't find the GM quote.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
