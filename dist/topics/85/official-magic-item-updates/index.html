The following items were impacted.</p>

<p><strong>New System</strong> </p>

<p>Generic MIU/Scroll CS</p>

<p>A new system has been added for Magic Items and Scrolls to allow additional CS and Maneuver bonuses for those skilled in the appropriate skill. Activating a CS spell from a Magic Item or Scroll will now grant a CS bonus similar to spell ranks using the following formula.</p>

<p>.75 CS per rank up to level</p>

<p>.5 CS per rank up to 2x level</p>

<p>.33 CS per rank over 2x level</p>

<p>Maneuver bonuses are sphere/spell specific but generally following the following pattern</p>

<p>.5 per rank up to level</p>

<p>.33 per rank up to 2x level</p>

<p>.1 per rank over 2x level</p>

<p>Note: Semi spell bonuses are halved.</p>

<p>As an additional note elemental and sorcerer spells are granted an additional bonus when wearing 1711 similar to that of 425. The calculation used is the same formula as 425 (25 bonus at 25 ranks and an additional bonus point up to a max of 50 at 75 ranks). This bonus is in additional to the base +10 CS granted by the base spell.</p>

<p><strong>Items</strong></p>

<p>Magic items/scrolls have had the following updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gold rings location settings are now detectable via. 405.</li>
<li>Bronze Squares (1718 - V'tull's fury) can now be activated from containers. </li>
</ul>

<p>This update addresses some issues weapon users had with needing to hold the square in the offhand to activate.</p>

<p><strong>Misc. Notes</strong></p>

<p>The mana verb has been updated with enhancive values to bring it in line with the other stats-related commands.</p>

<p>The messaging for 520 (Mage Armor) has had some updates to its messaging to help casters keep track of which elemental aspect is currently active. Spell Active has also been updated to reflect the current element in use.</p>

  <p>can you explain the 1711 update a bit better , I just used it from a scroll and i'm only seeing +10 CS on 703.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1711 update is strictly in reference to elementals/sorcerer spells that are used when using a magic item or scroll. So if you have 1711 active and use 415 it will grant you additional CS.</p>

<p>If you're using 1711 and casting a spell you know, it will still only grant +10 generic CS.</p>

<p>If you're saying you used 1711, then cast 703 from a wand or scroll, and you had at least 25 magic item/scroll ranks, then that's a bug I'll have to address. Was this the issue you saw?</p>

I believe the reason it isn't all that useful is because four of the compared factors are usually in the favor of the bandits themselves.  Those four factors are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Level (usually a wash or close)</li>
<li>DEX (not compared, but simply a bonus / detriment, I think)</li>
<li>STR (same as DEX)</li>
<li>Physical Fitness training</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding to this that the bonus the new system is granting is something on the order of 25 ranks with the spell (although unclear if it's 25 ranks flat, or 25 ranks + 12 ranks = 37 ranks), that is still well below 100 ranks.  </p>

<p>And capped mages with 100 ranks seem to tend to favor Elemental Wave (410) over Call Wind (912).  I know I do!</p></div></article><article id="post-596" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 12:56:23 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@vishra </p>

<p>I can take a stab at this one.  912 uses wizard spell ranks (and level?) to determine success.  You're effectively casting like a level 50 wizard against level 100 bandits.</p>

<p>I personally wouldn't mind giving 912 a boost to be more effective though, for wizards and those using magical items.  It doesn't seem to work very well at cap on a lot of things.

<p>As long there is an activation skill check (e.g. "1d100: 73 + Modifiers: 160 == 233"), it's working correctly.  100 MIU ranks only count the same as 50 wizard spell ranks.

  Force Projection (1207) is an offensive maneuver spell (sort of like a single-target e-wave) that increases in effectiveness based on MnM spell ranks. I think that's the sort of spell to which this update applies.
  It might also apply to Spike Thorn (616), Call Wind (912) and Grasp of the Grave (709). All three of those spells have an instantaneous effect, but all three also have the possibility for lingering effects. There is a runestaff somewhere, which has been sold several times, that casts Spoke Thorn. I assume that even with 202 MIU ranks a Cleric would never be as good at Spike Thorn as a Ranger.</p>

<p>Correct.</p>

<p>No. It affects offensive warding and maneuver spells when activated from magical items or scrolls. If said spell is also elemental in nature, 1711 will provide an additional boost (since ETD is calculated with the assumption 425 is active on elemental casters, said bonus also only applies if 425 is not active itself).</p>

<p>Hmm, apparently Mystic Focus would only add another +10 because, as a wizard, he already runs 425.  Apparently the MIU change will only add the additional +50 when running 1711 if the caster is <em>not</em> running 425 at the same time.</p>

  <p>So if I'm a sorcerer casting a cleric-circle CS spell off a scroll, do my MnS ranks still count toward my CS as well? Or is it now arcane symbols ranks only?</p>

<p>The system will use either your natural spell bonuses (known spells) or your arcane symbols ranks, whichever is higher, but they won't combine with each other. If you have a bonus of 423 from your spiritual spells, but a 450 CS from arcane symbols, your arcane symbols value will be used. If, on the other hand, you have a 423 bonus from your spiritual spells, but only a 327 CS from your arcane symbol contribute, your spell bonus will be used.</p>
