<p>Tonight is White Haven's Eve of Reunion Tour. We will stop by each CHE in the Icemule/Landing/Solhaven area to grab treats from your treat tent. We will also likely cause mischief and debauchery while we are there. All CHE officers are welcome to join us, and use this as an opportunity to discuss your house with event participants. If you would like to join the tour, event details are here: http://housewhitehaven.weebly.com/house-events.html </p>

<p>If you don't have time to participate in the entire tour but would like to be present during your stop, please contact me and I will let you know when the crew of rabble rousers are on our way.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
