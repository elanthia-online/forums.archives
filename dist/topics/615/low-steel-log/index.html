I then had her swing it at me so I could see what it was like, and she happened to get six rounds. Quite brutal! I had her test it on me again to see if I could berserk and break the stun, but the initial roundtime makes that moot, as the stun and roundtime wore off at the same time.</p>

<p>Quite a fantastic flare if the critter doesn't die from the initial blow(s).</p>

<p>Seomanthe says, "Er, don't die please."</p>

<p>Seomanthe swings a low steel falchion at you!
AS: +457 vs DS: +253 with AvD: +39 + d100 roll: +14 = +257
... and hits for 14 points of damage!
Quick slash catches your cheek!
Dimples are always nice.</p>

<p><em>* Seomanthe's low steel falchion unleashes a blast of psychic energy! *</em></p>

<p>Your mind is fragmented and scrambled by the force of the psychic blow! Horrific images begin to seep into the wide open cracks in your mind, nearly severing you completely from reality!
You are stunned!
Roundtime: 18 sec.</p>

<p>Horrible delusions assault your mind, while uncontrollable spasms wrack your body as your psyche crumbles under the continuing effects of the devastating psychic assault!
... 20 points of damage!</p>
