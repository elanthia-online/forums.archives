Most of those nouns don't ever seem to go with other items I'm wearing.  If I'm using a cloak, I think it looks kind of odd to add a longcoat or robes on top or underneath it.</p>

<p>This would be for a ranger, although it wouldn't need to be something specifically geared toward that profession.  Just looking to see what other ideas people have had to changing the noun on these.  I appreciate the help.</p></div></article><article id="post-3433" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 26th, 2017, 3:39:02 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Bath robe!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
