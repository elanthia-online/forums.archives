<p>PP's are becoming increasingly difficult to find, but given you can pad first and enchant after it'll make new HCP projects a lot cheaper.</p>

<p>Your just comparing 150 pts though. I think this system is putting higher tier padding on our radar and everyone is reacting to it based on our experience of how things were. </p>

<p>If W/P/S is going to be a standard service at merchants then people who attend events and pay for premium are going to move their gear forward faster.</p></div></article><article id="post-3664" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 3:34:11 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The biggest caveats to the success are Availability and Pricing.

Assuming it is accurate, a conversion of 750k silver to 1k Bloodscript is pretty favorable for coin usage.  Of course, if each merchant offers only 1pt at a time you would be hard pressed to get 20 or 25 additions in a two month period without some serious dedication. </p>

<p>""Cost and time-wise, while the prices will vary significantly based upon the exact attributes of your item, we have designed the system such that if you want to to gradually improve your 5x weapon from 0 to heavy weighting over a few years, you can do it for less than 12k bloodscrip (and will be able to break up part of that cost into silvers too) or for around 9m if you go the all-silvers route (silvers is the primary currency that we designed this for, BTW, not scrip or any other alternate currency).""</p></div></article></div></body></html>
