<p>In the gossamer web bag you see ten rosy gold-eyed orbweavers.</p>

<p>weighs 3, holds 24 (via loresong), I'm pretty sure it can be deepened with certificates</p>

<p><strong>CB 10 mil Fromer SOLD</strong></p>

<p>This auction will not be cross-posted on other forums. However, due to the newness of this board I will be taking bids on the LNET merchant channel and via pretty much any other communication method and will be calling at a slower rate than I have done in the past until I get bored. Any private bids better have a good reason.</p>

The creator has also provided the following information:
--------- SPIDER CONTAINERS - ANALYZE INFO  ---------</p>

<p>Spider bags house living spiders that can be customized.  Tier 2+ items are also part of the Ghule family of scripts.  To see Ghule interactivity options and syntax help for Tier 2, ANALYZE again within 15 seconds.</p>

<p>You get a strong sense that the bag can be altered by any merchant.  The bag must always be:
    (1) a "regular" container of some sort (no clothing, jewelry, etc.)
    (2) made out of webs or spidersilk.
    Long descriptions are fine; no shows.</p>

<p>When altering the spiders inside, bear in mind the following:
    (1) the article will always be a/an (for 1 spider) or a number such as 'two' (for multiple spiders)
    (2) the noun can be pretty much any type of spider, but note that descriptors go into the
         adjective field (eg. for 'brown recluse', 'brown' goes into the adjective field).
    (3) Spiders can have a long description tacked on after the base 15/15/15 but no show.</p>

<p>This item is currently Tier 2 (of 3) with 10 (of 10) spider(s).  Very few merchants can unlock it.  You have the max # of spiders.</p>

<h2>Features supported: WEAR, REMOVE, POINT my bag at {target}, OPEN, CLOSE, PULL, TURN (target option).</h2>

<p>You might be able to have a talented merchant lighten the gossamer web bag for you or deepen its pockets.
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>analyze bag
  You analyze your gossamer web bag and sense that the item is largely free from merchant alteration restrictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The creator has also provided the following information:
--------- SPIDER CONTAINERS - GHULE INFO, VERB SYNTAX  ---------</p>

<p>PULL interacts with Ghule cloaks and claws.
TURN interacts with Ghule claws, rings, and fangs.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble figuring out how to target a player on the 'target option' verbs, first make sure you are wearing the item.  Then use the syntax: <VERB> MY bag AT <player target></p>
