Sack of Cats. Auction Item. </p>

<p>8x, ball and chain base. 
Starts with somewhat damage weighting, somewhat crit weighting.</p>

<p>Adds 1 level of weighting for every dhu kitten you put inside the sack. </p>

<p>Ambient scripts, which change/evolve based on number of cats in the bag.</p>

<p><strong>Idea 2:</strong>
Simpler. Everyday item. I want a pipe that I can blow bubbles with. Blow bubbles and then say things like "indubably". Nobody smokes anymore. Convert all pipes to blow bubbles!</p></div></article><article id="post-2292" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 7:55:28 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You all laugh but some of my ideas get thru!

<li>Must become attuned to the blade, but only someone converted to Onar can make use of anything besides the flare</li>

<li>LICK - fully attuned or you die - you ingest the poison into yourself but it decreases all attacking RT to its base amount (disregard encumbrance), double swing flares on every swing, and you still get its normal flares.  This last for 1 minute after which you lose 6 spirit.  This ability can be used 1-3x per day.</li>
