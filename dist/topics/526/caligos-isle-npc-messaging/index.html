<blockquote>
  <p>ask clergyman about Arkati
  Squinting, the clergyman says, "If you are not a true believer, then you must give yourself to the mist, and then you will know Him."</p>
  
  <p>ask clergyman about blessing
  Nodding benevolently, the clergyman smiles and with the pointer finger of his left hand, draws a small circle in the air.  "I bless you, child of Caligos.  May the mist guide you and protect you.  May the eel spin before you, and may you never want for the weight of His influence."</p>
  
  <p>ask clergyman about cockatoo
  "Cockatoos," the clergyman says with disgust, "are the true deceivers of the world for they speak only the lies they hear and share them with any that will listen."</p>
  
  <p>ask clergyman about dolphins
  Frowning, the clergyman cautions, "Fear the dolphin, child, for they are the thieves in the water and a great evil.  They will steal you from the sanctuary that is Caligos and pull you from His Salvation."</p>

  <p>ask clergyman about frigatebirds
  "Those foul beasts," The clergyman howls with anger.  "They attempt to eat the truest body of Him, and I will have none of it!"</p>
  
  <p>ask clergyman about influence
  Eyeing you carefully, the clergyman says, "I can see that His influence is light upon you and you are without His sight."</p>
  
  <p>ask clergyman about island
  Admonishingly, the clergyman says, "You must stay on Caligos Isle, as it is the seat of Salvation.  Beyond its waters is a life filled with lies, but here you will want for nothing but the truth of the world.  This place can be beautiful again, and we can bring it that way for Him."</p>
  
  <p>ask clergyman about mist
  Smiling, the clergyman stretches his arms outward and is immediately wreathed in mist.  "The mist is our friend, our Salvation, and it will do a true believer no harm.  Do not fear the mist, for it will bring you true beauty and benefits."</p>

<li>Captain Junderthal</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>ask Junderthal about Charl
  Captain Junderthal says, "I used to say a prayer to the old man to guide me through rough waters," Junderthal says, "but I found Caligos, I know I'm blessed.  I don't need anyone to protect me anymore."</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about egg
  The Junderthal replies, "You should speak with the Ezreshi in the sea caverns about that."</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about Ghezresh
  Junderthal smiles softly at you, but he doesn't say a word.  His eyes flash with a silvery hue.</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about island
  Captain Junderthal sighs, gazing up at the sky in contentment.  "I felt a connection with this place from the moment the fog parted, and these enchanted shores revealed themselves to me," he says.  "I knew I had to share it!  I found my fortune here.  I know you'll find yours, too."</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about Junderthal
  He eyes you strangely.  "You're talking to 'im!"  He immediately turns his attention to the sky.</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about leave
  "You want to get home, don't you?" Captain Junderthal asks.  "No need to wait for me.  Just look for the portal near the docks.  The power of the sea will whisk you back from where you came."  He points the way, then resumes his stroll around the island.</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about luck
  Captain Junderthal smiles at you, a glint in his eye.  "You feel it, don't you?  The luck of the island, tickling your veins?  Don't be afraid, it's a gift!  A gift of this very special place."</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about mist
  Captain Junderthal checks over both shoulders, then leans in to answer you.  "A wise old captain once told me, when the sea tries to tell you something, listen."  He pats you on the shoulder, then casts his gaze out toward the fog.</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about name
  "Captain Junderthal of the Damsel of the Deep," the seafarer announces boastfully.</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about Niima
  Captain Junderthal cocks his head at you.  "Why do you care so much about gods and ghosts?" he asks.  "I say honor the ones who feed you."  He jingles his coin purse with a devilish wink.</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about song
  Captain Junderthal grins mischievously as he leans in to answer.  "I know a lot of sea songs, but none too polite.  Maybe I'll share a ditty or two if you catch me with a drink in my hands."  He pats you on the back and resumes his stroll.</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about spirits
  Captain Junderthal says, "You been drinking from the wrong side of the tankard?  Only spirits I care about are the kind that comes out of stills.  Catch my drift?"</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about voice
  Captain Junderthal winces at your question, furrowing his brow.  "Voices?" he asks.  "What voices?  I haven't heard a thing.  Have a drink, play a game, buy something fancy.  It'll ease your troubles."</p>
  
  <p>ask Junderthal about wrists
  Captain Junderthal scoffs at your question.  "These?  A tattoo gone wrong.  A bet gone worse.  Either way, I'm stuck with them, what's it matter?"  He shifts his jacket to conceal his wrists, then whistles a quick ditty with a forced ease.</p>

<li>a silver-eyed lithe elven woman</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>l woman
  Taller than average, the elven woman is lithe of body and lean of form.  Resting at a jaunty angle on her brow is a black leather tricorn, which is framed by the riotous ebon curls that spill down her back.  Streaks of indigo and silver stand out in the tresses, which mirror the silver of her eyes.  A signet ring adorns her left hand and is the only jewelry that she wears.</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about Arkati
  Worrying briefly and wringing her hands, the woman says, "I have forsworn Niima.  She does not understand me as once she did and can't know the comfort and peace that I have found here on Caligos Isle.  He does, and He will be my Salvation."</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about cockatoo
  Staring ahead dreamily, the woman says, "I had a cockatoo once.  She was my friend for many years, but after being on this island for a month, she suddenly changed.  She kept biting me and trying to bring me back to my ship... Why would I ever wish to leave Caligos Isle?"</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about dolphins
  Gazing over her shoulder towards the sea, she says, "It is the strangest thing...  I used to love playing with the dolphins...  They were the vessel of my lady, but since I have left her, they keep trying to drag me out to the sea and make me leave Caligos.  Isn't that strange?"</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about egg
  The woman replies, "You should speak to the warden about that."</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about frigatebirds
  Frowning, the woman says, "They eat the eels, and that's bad.  Right?  It's bad."</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about island
  Sighing contently, the woman gazes around with affection at the landscape around her and says, "Is there a more perfect island?  Can you feel His presence anywhere else?  Can you know Salvation anywhere else just by stepping foot on its soil?  I think not, and that is why I will never leave and never want for more."</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about mist
  "The mist?" the woman repeats.  "I don't think I mind the mists.  They bring news, and they touch me.  I was told they are Salvation...  my Salvation, and they bring Him to me."</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about name
  The lithe elven woman hesitates, as if in a trance.  She finally responds, "Captain Elyssbeth of Niima's Promise, I think... but these days, I can't even be certain."  She then shrugs slightly.</p>
  
  <p>ask woman about ring
  Glancing down at her hand, the woman says, "I found it in the caves.  I think it was on a water-logged skeleton.  It reminded me of long ago, of the elves that roamed the seas...  I did not think that they would mind... After all, I believe in Him like they did."</p>

  The playwright replies, "You should speak with the Ezreshi in the sea caverns about that."</p>
  
  <p>ask playwright about hobbies
  The playwright smiles slowly.  "My only hobby is turning the creatures on this island into characters for an epic play!"</p>
  
  <p>ask playwright about isle
  The playwright turns his attention to you, "Ah, Caligos Isle!  The best untold story, well, until now!  It's taken me a few months to really find my vision and my voice.  But soon, my tales of the island will be renowned!  Just you wait, and you will be able to say, alas, I knew him when!"</p>
  
  <p>ask playwright about name
  The playwright smiles and says, "Oh, me?  You may call me Opus.  In time, perhaps the Legendary Opus, whose name shall be known from sea to sea!"</p>
  
  <p>ask playwright about strangeness
  The playwright says softly, "I know of no strangeness other than the plot twists in the verses I carefully scribe!"  He chuckles softly and looks away from you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ask child about Arkati
  Tilting her head to the side, the child says, "You would have to ask Father Thrombe.  He knows all about Him."</p>
  
  <p>ask child about bracelets
  Lifting her arm, the child watches as the bracelets slink down her arm and says, "I find bits of string and yarn in the caves when the hucksters aren't looking and then I weave them into bracelets.  You'd be amazed at what people throw away."</p>
  
  <p>ask child about cockatoo
  The child screams and covers her ears, "Dirty birds!  Dirty lying birds!  Never trust a cockatoo!"</p>
  
  <p>ask child about dolphins
  The child starts to cry and begins to beg, "Please don't take me to the dolphins.  I'll be good."</p>
  
  <p>ask child about egg
  The child replies, "You should speak to the warden about that."</p>
  
  <p>ask child about frigatebirds
  Narrowing her eyes, the child says, "I hate those birds.  They are so mean, and when I can find a stick, I shoo them away."</p>
  
  <p>ask child about island
  The child's face rapidly shifts through emotions, and it seems as if haunted and sad are at war with one another.  Eventually, her expression settles on melancholy as she says, "My dad says we'll have to leave, but I can't leave.  I don't want to leave!  He needs us here, to be with Him.  To help save us all."</p>
  
  <p>ask child about mist
  "The mist is nothing to fear," the child says to you.  "It is His way of reminding you He is here."</p>
  
  <p>ask child about name
  "My name is Celesia," the elven child tells you.  She leans in and continues, "Father Thrombe says He picked out my name Himself, just for me!"  She looks down and smiles slightly to herself.</p>

  The carpenter says to you, "I've never been one to chat about religion, and I don't plan on starting today."</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about dolphins
  The carpenter mutters, "Folks been saying they're acting strangely.  To be honest, I don't see anything weird about 'em."</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about egg
  The carpenter replies, "You should speak with the Ezreshi in the sea caverns about that."</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about Ghezresh
  The carpenter stares at you blankly.  "Who?  What?  I'm just here to work.  Off with ya!"  He loudly shoos you away.</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about Junderthal
  The carpenter replies, "The captain is a good man.  There isn't anything wrong with having an eye for profit.  It's a good vision, really.  Providing something someone wants.  It makes sense.  I'm thankful the captain brought me over.  Between the shops, the tavern, and upgrading the pier, I've been kept very busy."</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about mist
  The carpenter rolls his eyes with a smirk.  "Mist, fog, clouds in the sky, dirt on the ground, water in the sea.  What do you expect from me?  I don't know anything except the boards beneath my saw and the jingling silvers in my pockets."</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about name
  The carpenter replies, "My name is Jerich.  I hadn't always been one to settle, but the prospect of good work the captain promised on this island definitely made it appealing.  I can't see myself leaving anytime soon.  Always something needing to be built."</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about salt
  The carpenter grins and gazes at you for a moment.  He whispers, "I hear that slugs don't take kindly to salt..."</p>
  
  <p>ask carpenter about slugs
  The carpenter groans.  "Pesky buggers leaving slime everywhere!  I almost slipped and fell on a slime trail just the other day."</p>

The child hugs his otter fiercely and nods in its direction for reassurance.</p>

<li>a lithe indigo-robed Ezreshi</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>ask Ezreshi about arkati
  Smiling, the Ezreshi serenely says, "There is only one to whom we pray, only one who is our salvation.  He has saved so many from the false promises of the destroyer.  You will know no better savior than Him.  Even His heirograms are pleasing and peaceful."  She leans down and swirls the mist with her fingertip.</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about Caligos
  Glancing around the cavern, a small smile playing on her lips, the Ezreshi says, "Caligos is the seat of His birth, the salvation in a sea of turbulence.  It is here that He brought the elves that were scattered by war, and it is here that He has brought us."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about chelioboros
  Drawing a perfect circle in the air with her left index finger, the Ezreshi explains, "The chelioboros is the perfect cycle of unity in Him.  The symbol is made up of His favored creature, the eel, and shows it consuming its own tail.  This is symbolic of His everlasting salvation."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about cockatoo
  Hissing slightly, Olienne quickly schools her features back into an expression of serene peace. "Silver-tongued fools are they.  You must not trust them, for they will repeat the lies that have fallen upon their ears.  Beware the emerald liars."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about convert
  Olienne nods knowingly.  "I see you have come to realize the value of His promise.  It is but the first step toward His salvation."  She reaches her hand to your shoulder and continues, "I used to fish in these caverns when I first arrived, but I was shown true Salvation.  Perhaps you, too, will be as fortunate.
  "  She continues, "I would often pray here.  I will listen if you would share a prayer with me."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about creatures
  "Many creatures have made the Isle their home," the Ezreshi says.  "The only one that matters has skin that glistens in the sunlight and shimmers in the moonlight.  Never a more beautiful sight than that, wouldn't you agree?"</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about dolphin
  Sighing heavily, Olienne says, "They will only whisk you away from salvation.  Heed their gentle nature, for it is only a ploy to remove you from this island."  She pauses before continuing, "You will find no clearer purpose in life.  What could be better than this?"  She spreads her arms wide and pirouettes in place.</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about eel
  Dipping her fingers into a nearby pool of mist, Olienne draws the mist up and around her until she appears wreathed in ethereal eels.  Smiling, she says, "They are of the sea, and they are of Ghezresh.  The twists of their body, the cunning of their hunt, and the grace of their movement have all drawn His eye.  Surely you can see the elegance in them."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about favor
  Olienne beckons you closer.  She whispers, "It is the strength of your awareness of Him while you are here on the shores of Caligos Isle.  Your time here counts; make it worth your while.  Should you find yourself in need, you can pay homage to Him with a PRAYer to me.  I am His messenger and will note your efforts."
  She adds, "If you must know specifics, seek higher ground and offer prayers.  You may be heard."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about Ghezresh
  Olienne shivers slightly as she hears you speak the name.  She says, "Fascinating how letters strung together can be so powerful, yes?  He is the one true savior.  Soon all will know of His work, and all will bond together for the greater cause.  There are immeasurable rewards awaiting all who follow His path.  If you desire the knowledge, you must do something for me."
  [Ask the ezreshi about CONVERT if you would like to know more...]</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about ghezyte
  Olienne says, "It is said that Caligos Isle is the only known location to harvest this precious material.  Found only near the most active and violent of undersea volcanos, it becomes harvestable once the originating eruption site rises above the water's surface.  Liquefied shale and glass, sea salt, and minerals combine in the creation of this powerful metal."  The Ezreshi takes a deep breath and gathers her thoughts before continuing, "This material is influenced by Him and all that He offers."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about hawk
  Lifting her fingers to her brow, she gently rubs away the scowl lines that begin to form on her luminous white forehead.  "Vile creatures, they are.  They terrorize His cherished creatures and serve no purpose other than to cause us anguish."  She waves her hand dismissively.</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about Junderthal
  With hand upon her heart, Olienne says, "Junderthal is a good man and a great captain.  He holds a fondness in my heart, for had he not agreed to let me journey with him, I would not know this salvation."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about loss
  Olienne says, "The horror of that one act upon Him is too much for me to share at this time.  The atrocities were unthinkable, and the consequences immeasurable.  Fear not, for we will rebuild."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about mist
  A lithe indigo-robed Ezreshi wiggles her fingers towards the mist that clings to the ground.  It rises to meet her fingers as she says, "There is nothing to fear from the mist.  It is His hand that reaches out to offer you His salvation.  Will you embrace it?"</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about rebuild
  Olienne whispers, "Your desire to know Him is recognized, but you do not possess enough seashells for this exchange."
  Olienne gives you a strange look.</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about seashell
  Olienne says, "I often listen to the sounds of the sea, peaceful and calm in a land of chaos and torment.  It reminds me of Him."  She gazes off into the distance, a faraway look in her eyes.  "Forgive me.  I was lost in my own thoughts.  Seashells... I collect them.  Have you been to the upper plateau?  Are you familiar with the rebuild?  If not, you should.  His time draws near."</p>
  
  <p>ask Ezreshi about temple
  Olienne's eyes light up as she speaks, "The temple, His holy ground, was lost to the ravages of the sea.  It will soon be whole again, and true believers will flock to His worship.  If you wish to aid the cause, ask me about the rebuild."</p>

But I tell you, that cockatoo was wise, it soared to the island, and I can hear it calling to the captain sometimes when the wind is high."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about curse
  Flapping his arms with exasperation, the sailor exclaims, "Gods, but I wish I knew!  I can't figure it out.  Is it the relics?  Is it the air?  Something keeps people here, something steals them from you, and by Charl's salt-encrusted whiskers, you can bet that I'll never set foot on that rock again."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about egg
  The sailor replies, "You should speak with the Ezreshi in the sea caverns about that."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about Elyssbeth
  Licking his lips, the sailor opens his mouth to speak, but stops to clear his throat.  Closing his eyes for a long moment, he finally manages to say, "She's my captain, my love.  Her eyes are like the moonlight dancing upon the back of a dolphin in a becalmed water.  I just want her back, back at my side, so we can sail away."  He sighs again and whispers, "Sail anywhere."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about isle
  The sailor gives you a strange look.</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about Junderthal
  Shrugging, the sailor says, "What of the man?  He's a good captain, but he's not mine.  He sees profit under every rock, but mine saw history.  He can have this rock for all I care, I just want Elyssbeth back."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about leave
  Strangling a sob before it can fully form in his throat, the sailor manages to say, "I can't.  We can't.  Niima's Promise is Elyssbeth's, and we owe it to her to wait."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about mist
  Worrying and wringing his hands, the half-elven sailor eyes the pier as if suddenly the mist may appear upon it.  "Heed my words, stay away from it.  No good can come from something that unnatural-looking."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about name
  Confused by the question, the half-elven sailor seems surprised to be asked who he is and with a careless shrug says, "First Mate Jothi of the Niima's Promise."</p>
  
  <p>ask sailor about Niima
  Half sobbing, half sighing, the sailor says, "I keep praying that she'll take mercy on us and send the captain back, but my prayers are getting thin, and my hope is fading."</p>

<li>a garrulous dwarven harbormaster</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>ask harbormaster about dolphins
  Squinting slightly, the harbormaster gazes out at the sea and says, "She's trying to find something on the land, but she keeps back from the mist.  I once saw her set upon by a bed of eels.  She returned a few days later.  I know her by the azure mark on her tail fin."</p>
  
  <p>ask harbormaster about egg
  The harbormaster replies, "You should speak with the Ezreshi in the sea caverns about that."</p>
  
  <p>ask harbormaster about hip
  Instinctively placing his large hand on his hip, the harbormaster gives a crooked grin before saying, "I wasn't always a harbormaster.  I used to work on the Damsel of the Deep, but an accident put me out of commission for a long time.  Truth be told, I'm lucky to be able to walk, and I owe Captain Junderthal for giving me this job."</p>
  
  <p>ask harbormaster about isle
  Grinning, the harbormaster says, "Caligos Isle was found by Captain Junderthal of the Damsel of the Deep.  He discovered everything from the ruins at the high plateau to the caverns below."</p>
  
  <p>ask harbormaster about mist
  Frowning, the harbormaster says, "I try to stay out of the mist."
  He quickly raises his hand before him in a negating gesture and says, "Not, mind you, that is has harmed anyone.  It hasn't that I know of, but I just don't like the feel of it."</p>
  
  <p>ask harbormaster about name
  "They call me Saults," the harbormaster answers you somewhat disinterestedly.</p>
  
  <p>ask harbormaster about strangeness
  "What?" the harbormaster asks in an oddly loud voice.  With a forced laugh, he says, "No, no strangeness.  And whatever you may hear from that clergyman, it is probably false.  Things are fine."</p>
