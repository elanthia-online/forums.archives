We just were debating which one to use.  Also I didn't make it.  No, we don't have CHEs in Plat.  I'm really hoping to make use of these forums but I'd like Plat, and Shattered, to have their own sections to discuss things specifically pertinent to them.</p></div></article><article id="post-336" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 11:41:07 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Done... I didn't include an MHO specific folder under both Plat and Shattered.  Given the relative numbers of those instances, I don't anticipate that there would be enough discussion to necessitate a whole other category for it.  However, I'll be more than happy to spin it up if I'm wrong... It's just easier to create less and add more than to add more and reduce the number in the future.</p></div></article><article id="post-337" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kithus</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 11:47:59 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Fair enough.

It's really just a formality for the generalness we discussed via Discord.  None of us really care to chase things down on an individual post by post basis, but if things get to a point where we need to have discussions about a particular member between admins, it'll likely result in an action taken.  Right now, I would rather we spend time making the UI better for everyone, like the categories you just suggested, and some other usability and interface concerns.</p></div></article><article id="post-392" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 2:39:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'd prefer them to be below the profession talk categories.

<p>Generally the layout needs to be much more condensed as these two categories alone force an addition screen of scrolling.</p></div></article><article id="post-407" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 3:34:55 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>We will not be ignored!</p></div></article><article id="post-476" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 8:19:49 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin I agree with @allereli  - They should be below the general gemstone categories.  At the very least they should be below the marketplace.</p>

<p>They're going to be used less and should fall lower in the priority listings.</p></div></article><article id="post-491" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Hips</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 12:00:41 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Hey, I just wanted to thank you for getting the Platinum categories set up.
