1 | gleaming black rolaren waraxe | 3 pounds max light 7x lightning flaring handaxe. | SHOW: Forged by expert weapon makers, the rolaren waraxe is dyed a gleaming black hue. Set upon the head of the pommel is an intricate carving of a demon's face with sparkling ruby-set eyes. A fine black leather grip has been braided down the heft, while razor-sharp serrated teeth are notched down the length of the blade. You see nothing unusual, except for a small enchanter's glyph. | 13m |
2 | thin black rolaren longsword | 5 pounds 6x lightning flaring longsword | SHOW: This thin-bladed longsword is forged from strong black rolaren which gleams like liquid metal. The crossguard has been fashioned into the shape of a demon's head inset with two tiny ruby eyes, its fearsome teeth grasping the rolaren and joining it to the black leather-bound hilt. You see nothing unusual, except for a small enchanter's glyph. | 8m |
