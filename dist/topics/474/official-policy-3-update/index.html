<p>Super small but important update to make extra clear that Policy 3 (which covers Disruptive and Abusive Behavior) does, in fact, apply to all of our official venues:</p>

<p>Housed under General Behavior --> "This applies to all interactions within the in-game environment, the official GSIV Forums, GSWiki, and any areas of official communication."</p>

<p>From nearby, you hear Ordim yell, "Dont eat meeeeee!"</p>

<p>The shaggy mutt sniffs at a vine-painted mistwood keg, then grabs it in its teeth and greedily wolfs it down before anyone can grab it!</p>

  <p>@GameMasters Does the Policy 3 update include Discord, the new unofficial forums, or Slack?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyrom - Just official communication channels, like GemStone IV Facebook, Twitter, and eventually other areas. We had an instance or two recently where a player became vulgar on Twitter. Bringing it into the game.</p></div></article><article id="post-4947" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 11th, 2017, 11:36:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I thought the same thing, Mogonis.

<p>Just to piggyback off Kaikala here. This should have been known, but several incidents have recently come up where it was clear that it wasn't known. That's why we're spelling it out. </p>

<p>Other areas of official communication would be places like the official Facebook and Twitter accounts, which recently had some disruptive behavior happening (racial slurs being direct messaged, taking things happening in game to social media and vice verse). Again, we assume this is a bit of common sense, but it doesn't appear everyone thinks the same.</p>
