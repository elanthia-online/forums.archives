<p>We have been particularly fortunate for the past 10 years or so in Florida... and people are forgetting how utterly devastating they can be.</p>

<p>3' of rain?  Sheesh!</p>

<p>Hope your family gets through this.</p></div></article><article id="post-3707" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 10:15:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Me too.  It's heart breaking that they hadn't even recovered from the last storm when Harvey hit.  At this point, I think there's nothing they'd rather do than move out of Houston, but they're underwater, (too soon?) with their home loan I'm sure.  They haven't lived in their house in 18 months and they've been making mortgage and utility payments the whole time.  I'm kind of secretly hoping the house has floated down the creek so they can total it and move on with their lives.  So long as they survive.  The photos they've been posting are insane.</p></div></article><article id="post-3720" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 12:13:58 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I just got done poking (more) holes in the ceiling to prevent bubbles forming.

<p>The water has receded and they've been able to get to their house, (had to wade the last quarter mile).  Water looks to have topped out at around 2' up from the floor. Unfortunately, with so much win driven rain, they also have a lot of water that came through every roof penetration, so they've got sagging drywall ceilings, which of course in Houston have insulation above them, so that's all wet too.  All their newly installed walls, cabinetry, and floors are destroyed.  Amazingly, they have power, which nearly burned the house down.  They had a circuit that was shorting and didn't trip the breaker for some reason.  It was a floor outlet and had burned up the subfloor and the top floor was hot to the touch.  Another day and it probably would have caught fire.</p>

<p>End result is that it looks like I'm headed to Houston to help him strip his house down to the studs before everything is covered in mold.  This will be the second time they've had to do this in 18 months.</p></div></article><article id="post-3990" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 8:38:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Store and businesses started opening today.
