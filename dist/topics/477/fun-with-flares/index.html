<p>*Note- you can see how the flare bonus full affinity, T3 parastic weapons get works here.  The messaging "strike dents the war griffin's larynx" is a 5 point crit on the slash table, but it actually did 30 points of damage.  I don't believe you typically see a corresponding increase in rank of the wound, however.  But 25 extra points of damage isn't half bad.

<p><strong>Bonus Commentary:</strong>
That was 5 separate lurks, all "fresh" before, all dead after.  Only 2 rotflares out of the 5, because 3 of them were dead before the flare had a chance to trigger.  My ensorcell AS flares are +30 and last for three swings.</p>

<p>There are a few undead creatures which "have blood", lurks being one.  I think Wyrom mentioned that this "may be a bug" not too long ago.  So rotflares works on them.</p>

<p>The pike has rotflares, ironwright flares, and ensorcell (and other stuff but that's all of the flaring).</p>

<p>The rotflares trigger on every strike (aside from killing blows, or ineligible creatures).  The first strike causes a disease that triggers about 70-75 hidden damage, 2-3 seconds after that initial hit.  If that doesn't finish it, there's also a a visible "damage over time" minor flare at the same time, good for an average of 9 damage and, rarely, a knockdown or stun. The hidden disease + visible DoT will trigger again every 30 seconds, which is nice if someone gets me in a long stun or whatever.</p></div></article><article id="post-7173" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 2nd, 2017, 1:05:45 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Yay!
