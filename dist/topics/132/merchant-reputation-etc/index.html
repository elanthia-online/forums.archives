<p>This mostly just occurred to me as I asked some guy to send me $$$ on paypal.  He probably doesn't know who I am and I don't know who he is.  Skeptical bear says hello.</p>

<p>Are we thinking of any solutions for this?</p></div></article><article id="post-962" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 5:56:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>We still have similar controls in place as what their was on the PC.

<p>Truth! I never used rep for that anyways. We'll just need to be extra careful until names are established.</p></div></article><article id="post-981" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">peam</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 6:48:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Can we sticky a merchant feedback thread?
