It is NSFW and  has very adult themes (I wouldn't let a 13 year old read this).  The artwork is just stunning and the story is very good.  This isn't a Bleach/Naruto manga.  Each panel is created with amazing intricacy.  Go read it now and share my obsession. </p>

<p>Yu-Gi-Oh the abridged series is hilarious.</p></div></article><article id="post-3303" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">mark</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 12:49:07 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Hajime no Ippo (though I haven't kept up with it for the past couple years) if you think boxing is neat.</p>

<p>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Araki's got a unique style, probably my favorite serial-manga artist. Series 2 and 4 are my favorites (Battle Tendency and Diamond is Unbreakable).</p>

<p>My geekiness has been more western-oriented lately, so I'll also mention <a href="http://chewcomic.blogspot.com/">Chew</a>. It's a must-read if you can stomach (heh) the subject matter.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
