<p>There seems to be a lot of new users showing up, which is great.  </p>

<p><strong>we welcome you</strong></p>

<h2>Who</h2>

<p>I've seen a fair amount of speculation on LNet as to who is controlling these forums.  I am the creator/admin (my PC handle is m444w if you are unaware).  I currently have given two community members moderator access: @Whirlin and @horibu because of their track records as being standup individuals in dealing with the community.</p>

<p>Here is a few things to keep in mind:
1. this is not the PC.  We have a <a href="https://forums.elanthia.online/topic/2/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> for participating in our community.  Generally if you are respectful of the dignity of <strong>all</strong> of your fellow humans, especially when expressing differences of opinion, you will be fine.
2. these are not your grand-pappy's forums. They are feature rich, and i'm sure it will take awhile for us all to get use to them.  If there is anything obviously buggy or problematic, feel free to PM myself or one of the moderators.
3. There is likely to be some growing pains while we are all figuring this out.  If you have questions or concerns, feel free to PM me or reach out to me on Discord/Slack/LNet/AIM/here.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Markdown</strong>
markdown is a powerful syntax to write formatted text, you can read more on it <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">on the cheatsheet</a> or on the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">official documentation</a>.  Due to security concerns, you <strong>cannot</strong> use the raw HTML feature spoken about on either of those documents.  There are several scripts that allow you to dump items to <code>.csv</code> files and upload them to Google spreadsheets, you can also export these to tables to easily generate a wonderful markdown post using several online tools.  <a href="https://donatstudios.com/CsvToMarkdownTable">this is one i use to generate markdown tables from item spreadsheets</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tags</strong>
tags are another powerful feature of this forum, and they can help people quickly find relevant info and are more akin to custom topics.  <strong>please be respectful</strong> with tag creation, so they still retain their power, where possible <strong>prefer singular</strong> tag names such as <code>weapon</code> and <code>armor</code> versus <code>weapons</code> and <code>armors</code> or <code>announcement</code> vs <code>announcements</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alt Accounts</strong>
Do not create alt accounts.  Please maintain one identity on these forums, namely one that people can find you with.  If someone is harassing you, then they are violating the CoC (code of conduct)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GameMasters</strong>
Please be respectful of GameMasters, they are essentially unpaid <strong>volunteers</strong> that provide us with a labor of love.  You can critique work, but never demean a person.  GMs are humans too.</p></li>

<p>Whirlin has stated more than once that the Code of Conduct is lifted from a generic one found via Google(maybe something else?) search. </p>

<p>If you actually read the one at the linked site, instead of just posting it to "LOL FEMINISM", you can see that it's been tinkered with and is different than the one here.</p></div></article><article id="post-533" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 6:08:33 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@peam Sorry I didn't print a copy of each and hold it up to the light to see the differences.  The first half is basically word for word.</p>

<p>No, that is BS.  There is almost zero chance they just happened upon that Code of Conduct page.  That is something that was actively looked for.  Do a google search for yourself and see the results.</p></div></article><article id="post-534" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">peam</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 6:12:01 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage like this:</p>

<p>It's clearly a generic CoC that is used by a ton of different sites, most of which seem to be tech/coding oriented.</p></div></article><article id="post-535" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 6:30:04 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@peam <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/xT5LMutNZQ7yGJJYAM/giphy.gif" alt="alt text" title="" /></p></div></article><article id="post-682" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kalros</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 4:45:19 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I look forward to being a positive beacon of light for future generations.
