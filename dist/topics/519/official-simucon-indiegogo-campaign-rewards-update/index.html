<p>Hey everyone, we're sorry about the delay in this goodie bag. Some staffing changes happened during the development of the Goodie Bag that has delayed the distribution of the items.
The memento item is being finalized and then everything will be ready. Due to the delay, we'll also be adding an additional item to the Goodie Bag.</p>

<p>In previous years, a GameMaster usually tries to track everyone down in game, but moving forward, we're going to use another system that we already use for global item distribution to hopefully speed this up.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for the delay.</p></div></article><article id="post-5492" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 27th, 2017, 10:37:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Glad I got the goodie bag, free rotflare certs as an extra reward sounds over the top but I'm not complaining.</p></div></article><article id="post-5493" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 27th, 2017, 10:38:59 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>heh.</p></div></article><article id="post-5494" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 27th, 2017, 11:28:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>So many questions regarding this update.</p></div></article><article id="post-5495" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 27th, 2017, 11:44:16 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim Don't ask them, that's the quickest way to get them answered!</p></div></article><article id="post-5563" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 2:49:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Wyrom If we purchased a perk and have not received this email update, do you need any follow-up on our end?

<p>it's whatever email you used for the Indigogo. So if you're like me and have an email solely for GS, it might be different and go to what you would use for Indigogo instead.</p>

<p>There wasn't any action for us to take in the email.</p></div></article><article id="post-5583" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 3:38:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli I believe I used the same email address that's on file with Simu, because I do recall receiving an earlier Indigogo verification.

<p>For those who purchased the SimuCon Goodie Bag, you should now have access to the Roisterer title. For anyone who doesn't have access to the title, but purchased the goodie bag, email me your account name at gs4-estild@play.net.</p>
