I will share more details with you all when it’s appropriate to do so. Thanks for your patience, I hope that you all enjoy 1650 as much as I’ve enjoyed designing and building it.</p>

<p>From the language, it seems designed,coded, and ready for release. What are your thoughts on this new spell since HSN?</p>

<p>Reality speculation: It's a roundabout basic offensive/defensive buff which is fine since the class is a lot of fun to play already.</p>

<p>Hope speculation: Super bonding with your weapon. Something something flares, I love flares. Arkati based buff to offensive power.</p>

<p>Dreams of Delusions speculation: A unique spell, perhaps based around a familiar like mount... that you can ride around on.
