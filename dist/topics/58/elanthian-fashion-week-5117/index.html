The fun kicks off tomorrow morning at 10.00am with coffee, cake, and a lecture on the do’s and don’ts of alteration work, to be delivered by a guest speaker from Elanthian Elegance. This will be held in the Landing Hall, Auditorium (lich # 385, go door, west, go oak door). Please note that this will be an IC discussion on how to tackle alters with hints and tips on making the most of your time with a merchant. All OOC questions should be kept to group whispers wherever possible.</p>

<p>At 2.00pm, there will be an informal discussion about trends in the elegant surroundings of the refurbished Atelier in Elaraeyn's Boutique (lich # 24595).

The fun doesn’t end there as the Mentors invite you to join them in the Silverwood Manor to round off the day. Test your creative skills with a fun and fast-paced game of Picture This! at 10.00pm.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a cart selling cobbling supplies for all your fashionable footwear needs in the Sylvanfair Grove (lich # 8753, go west).</p></div></article><article id="post-1654" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rohese</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 6:33:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p><strong>Fashion Week 5117 ~ Volnes, 14th day of Phoenatos (Monday 14th August)</strong></p>

Join the Black Hand Trading Co. for a discussion and presentation on the art of communicating -- a skill often seen in fashionable Nalfein court circles.

<p>Rise and shine fashionistas!  It’s time to get your sashay on and strut your stuff on the runway.  The doors to the Ebonstone Manor Ballroom* will open at 3.00pm for registration or to grab a good seat for the show.   </p>

<p>Your entry will be judged on presentation (how well you present your outfit on the runway through verb use etc.) and interpretation of the theme.  As a reminder, the choice of themes for this year’s Fashion Showcase are Shabby Chic, Metallic Mastery, Sugar and Spice, and Woodland Walks.  Whilst there is no time limit – we don’t want to stifle your creativity – we do ask that you aim for maximum impact in as short a time as possible please; leave the audience wanting more! </p>

<p>The winner will walk away with the coveted Chalat Award so come and support any friends and family who are participating, or just come for the spectacle.</p>

<p>Before that however, the last in the series of Breakfast Lectures will be held in the Landing Auditorium.  We’ll be gathering in the Courtyard (#385) at 10am and enjoying coffee and cake before we learn more about masks.  Don’t forget to enter the raffle while you there as it draws shortly afterwards and then stop by at the wagon parked on the North Ring to buy your very own mask for the ball later.</p>

<p>At 1pm, there will be an informal gathering in the Ebonstone Manor ballroom to chat with fellow collectors of Delirium Manor’s Whax Dolls.  Bring along your spare parts and accessories to exchange or simply come to show your fashionably dressed (or not) doll! </p>

<p>Following the Showcase, at 9.00pm, it’s time to dress up again as the Alliance of High Elven Society invite you to dance the night away at their Masquerade Ball.</p>

<p>Only two more days to finish your shopping.  The clearance sale of the themed shoe collections continues with prices slashed, so head over to the Ta’Illistim shop (lich # 731, go cottage) and grab yourself a last minute bargain.  The cart selling cobbling supplies can be found in the Sylvanfair Grove (lich # 8753, go west).  There’s still time to enter the remaining Fashion Week raffles too.

<p>Members of Elanthian Elegance and The Looking Glass for going along with my insane idea in the first place and letting me do it all over again.  </p>

<p>All the CHEs, MHOs, and Mentors who hosted fantastic events and raffles during the week and made it the success it was.</p>

<p>GMs Elidi and Elysani for their endless patience with my constant demands for calendar entries, criers, raffle tables, props and, of course, the glossy booklet!  You two are simply amazing and we are so lucky to have you supporting us.  </p>

<p>Airisu, Oirisu, Farain for allowing me to use their fashionable prowess in Fashion Wars!  You will have your revenge next year, I promise.</p>

<p>GM Valyrka for honouring the Fashion Showcase Chalat Award winners with their names on a statue to be placed in the Museum Alerreth soon.  Congratulations to Nihrvanah for winning it this year!  </p>

<p>An honourable mention to Newsby of the TownCrier who helped in promoting the events and to Jastalyn for her amazing <a href="http://www.fenogs.com/fashion.html">Fenog’s Fashion Formation</a>. </p>

<p>Last, but by no means least, everyone who attended the events and entered the raffles; it wouldn’t have been possible without you guys!  </p>

<p>I apologise if I’ve forgotten anyone but my brain is like marshmallow at the moment.  Rohese is now going to lie down in a dark room with a cold towel on her head – and I’ll probably join her.  </p>
