<p>Yes, that works for me.  How do you want to handle delivery?  There are 444 items total, plus 1 for the container they will come in.</p></div></article><article id="post-1543" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 7:54:34 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir 
If I get you some jars can it be jarred up? It's still going to be a good amount of jars but much more manageable overall. 
I'll make it an even 4m for time jarring etc</p></div></article><article id="post-1544" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 7:54:56 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim said in <a href="/post/1543">Need ingredients for finishing alchemy</a>:</p>
