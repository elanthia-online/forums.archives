<p>Weighting, padding, or sighting can now be added (very slowly) to pretty much anything as a merchant service. So you can now put weighting on a flaring or permablessed item. You cannot go the other way, though - there is a limited ability to add flares or blessing to low weighted weapons (i.e. less than 10 points).</p>

<p>Also weighted/sighted/padded stuff can be enchanted now. Claidhmores are still pretty much impossible to player enchant, but HCW can be done.</p>

<p>Lots of other stuff but that one is the biggest. Empaths just got some updates to healing and a new healing spell.</p></div></article><article id="post-7883" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, December 14th, 2017, 10:11:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Pretty good recap.
