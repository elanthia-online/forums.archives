<p>I wanted to take a moment to address some concerns about the wiki.</p>

<p>When Simutronics acquired the Krakiipedia, the wiki became an official source of documentation. While the wiki will remain player-driven, our GameMasters will also continue to correct outdated and erroneous information. This has been a work in progress, and we still need to make it more clear which articles are considered official.</p>

<p>During the transition from the Krakiipedia to the GS Wiki, a number of players stood out and helped us with the overwhelming tasks of formatting and correcting the wiki. Many of these players became our first moderators of the wiki. These are the key people who helped shape the wiki for us and pushed for a style guide that we strive to use. </p>

<p>Our lead moderator is currently Allereli. She has put in a vast number of hours and continues to uphold to the standards that were set forth. If you look at her contributions, you can quickly see the huge investment of her time and heavy amount of edits she has performed. </p>

<p>I do realize everyone puts in a lot of effort into the wiki, especially when you spend a lot of time formatting and adding information. It is not a slight to anyone if one of our moderator steps in to either inform you of some needed formatting changes or to lock down a page until things get clarified. This is what they were set to uphold when they became a moderator for our wiki.</p>

<p>One of the concerns that recently came up are when a moderator locks a page or reverts some information. Again we realize a lot of effort goes into these edits. Be mindful that if something is official documentation or an article was edited by a GameMaster, it's something that should get signed off on before making an edit. Using the Village Pump or the Discussion Tab at the top of each article is the best way to communicate an edit.</p>

<p>We appreciate everything everyone does for our wiki. You all help make the GemStone IV community informed and keep documentation more easily to find.</p>

<p>Wyrom, PM</p></div></article><article id="post-4291" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">GS4Menos</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 9:17:51 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm not sure that really addresses the complaints as far as I've seen them.</p></div></article><article id="post-4293" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 9:22:09 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@gs4menos Can you summarize them?

<p>Admining or Moding anything is a thankless job, while trying to keep things to match your potentially subjective vision.  I mean, sure we have our Scribe of Elanthia titles and stuff from previous Wiki competitions and stuff... but, that doesn't really encompass the amount of work done.  There are so many content articles out there from god knows who that require reading/indexing/potentially deletion/etc... Not to mention people making shit that they think is important but doesn't fit anything and shouldn't be there.  It's a job even I wouldn't want to do.  I think if I also joined the wiki moderators and became an active wiki mod, Simu would need to start paying me.</p></div></article><article id="post-4307" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Estild</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 11:17:46 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/4301">Official: Wiki Moderation and Management</a>:</p>

<p>This.  A consistent user experience goes a long way to make a better end product.  I'm an exceedingly grateful for all the work the authors, editors, and moderators put into the wiki.  I often use it myself to look up information.</p></div></article><article id="post-4313" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 12:06:58 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>My only complaint is that sometimes the meat and potatoes info on a subject is sometimes missing or given light treatment.

<p>I absolutely don't disagree... but, given such a distributed user base, Allereli needs to act as the stick that keeps the people in line that don't have the time/energy/interest in participating in that class.

<p>this is the "crap" I gave you:</p>

<p>Please do not use the Profession template as that adds the Profession category to the page, but you can take the code minus the category from the template. Thank you. VANKRASN39 (talk) 13:59, 8 May 2017 (CDT)</p>

<p>Many people leap to "I'm never going to edit" with any sort of moderation at all. I don't have the energy to  try to convince to you do otherwise. </p>

<p>I have responded to each complaint on the officials describing exactly what happened.  One of the people who posted, I have no clue what their complaint is, as they have zero editing history that would indicate any problem whatsoever.  </p>

<p>If pointing out that using a specific template is problematic caused personal distress to you, I apologize, but guides need to be kept out of the profession category.  If you are unsure of how to do something, ask, that's what the Talk/Discussion pages are for.</p>

<p>As for getting grief for the entire time you were writing (May 7-June 19), I sent you one email the day I wrote on the talk page to make sure you saw the message.  I did not send you any further messages after that.  You were given no grief whatsoever, and I do not appreciate you making that up.</p></div></article><article id="post-4332" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 12:58:38 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli said in <a href="/post/4330">Official: Wiki Moderation and Management</a>:</p>

<p>Did you read the GM response? I also pushed for a GM response (as well as GM participation in all aspects of the Wiki) as I had already addressed each and every complaint individually with specifics, and discussed each and every complaint with Wyrom and/or Kaikala.  </p>

<p>Thank you. The Simutronics office staff is well aware of my email addresses and I'm sure will resolve the issue.  I fully trust them to take the appropriate action.</p>

<p>I am fully willing to cooperate in whatever way if further information is needed, including providing a list of devices I own, and allowing Google and Yahoo to release information to Simutronics of my usage habits, as I've used both email services to do business with them.  I only use one email address for the wiki and that same email address for my accounts, as I stopped using one for each account last month. I do not hide or change my IP addresses in any way, as the admins of this board can attest to.</p></div></article><article id="post-4381" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">SaltySenorita</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 5:53:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I've edited a few wiki articles here and there because misspellings make me itchy and have made a few tiny content additions to existing pages.  In the beginning I didn't entirely grasp the "official" aspect of it, probably butchered some formatting, and maybe stepped on some contributor toes.  Two or possibly three times I've been contacted by Allereli about formatting or other minor concerns.  She was absolutely professional.  I'm certain my clumsy initial forays into editing are probably multiplied a hundred-fold with others who attempt to help with it, and I know for me that would get old fast.</p>

<p>She spends a lot of time, y'all. A lot. Have you ever edited one of the tables? Even with someone else's foundation laid it's time consuming and thankless.  If she's not warm and cuddly enough for some people when she corrects them, I think that's more their problem than hers.  A lot of the complaints I've seen on the officials appear (from the outside looking in) largely ego-driven.  Some people are taking stuff way too personally.  </p>

<p>@Flimbo:  Entirely separate from that and not meaning to imply you are one of those at all... I know you're feeling badgered at the moment, but I would not mind seeing a log of the all of the contact you had over your wiki issue pasted to this thread.  I don't think I'm alone in that curiosity and I am open to reevaluating my take on this if it genuinely is excessive.  I haven't seen anyone post specifics on a situation with the wiki moderation yet and it could be very enlightening.</p></div></article><article id="post-4384" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Soulance</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 6:27:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I tried helping add to and edit a few articles myself.

    <p>My only complaint is that sometimes the meat and potatoes info on a subject is sometimes missing or given light treatment. It's ok if things are missing, so long as we aren't pretending that it's all there or that we know everything. I think notes on Wikipedia for example, that say things lime "citation needed" encourage peoe to participate, for example. The more people that we can encourage to be involved the better. Maybe we should think about how we're doing that? A class on protocol maybe wouldn't hurt either.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>I absolutely don't disagree... but, given such a distributed user base, Allereli needs to act as the stick that keeps the people in line that don't have the time/energy/interest in participating in that class.  I think that such a class would be in too much, preaching to the choir.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there are too many people who are intimidated by the process, or who's first interaction with someone who has a lot of passion for it is when they've done and edit and the formatting or something gets changed by someone else afterwards. A good way to talk to people about contributing in an encouraging fashion would not be preaching to the choir at all, unless the volumes of knowledgeable players who aren't currently participating is the choir.</p></div></article><article id="post-4391" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 8:21:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I've tried making a wiki article.

<p>Thank you for the compliment.  I don't wish to further argue, I have enjoyed the times we have met in person, and you should know based on that that I have absolutely no ill will or hard feelings towards you.  But since I am addressing all complaints/situations shared, I will address this as well:</p>

<p>https://gswiki.play.net/Settlement<em>of</em>Reim/saved_posts </p>

<p>We almost always have a saved post page for major releases.  If we don't it's because someone writes a fully formatted and organized article first.  The saved posts as a whole are highly organized, and as further information is released for each subject, we go back to them to write the actual article, which I believe was your goal. You were pasting the text anyway, so I requested you help out in the normal fashion of what we do with that text.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Every situation and person is different, and types of pages are different and receive different levels of moderation, so I like to use specific examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When someone starts a new page for every saved post for a storyline. Sometimes they don't even indicate what storyline it is for.  I've really worked hard to streamline that type of information and you can see about a half dozen perfectly acceptable ways to do it depending on how the information is posted and how much people participate. Yet people don't bother looking at the end product.  I have spent days sorting storyline posts out.  </p></li>
<li><p>The articles we're having the most issues with are the existing articles, not new ones. New articles rarely have problems that reach the scope of the OP complaints about the WPS table lockdown. 
In your case it looked like you were going to just paste the saved posts and leave them, as many have done, so I asked you to add the template because I'd have to do that anyway, and you got upset and clarified your intentions, and you continued and everything was peachy keen. 
When people just abandon the text, I'd rather just do it myself.   There are tools such as the work-in-progress template and sandboxes (I know about creation issues, move your page into a user page after page creation and it's fine) that people should be using more, as well as the Village Pump, Request page and Talk pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, if you're going to refuse to read the Style Guide, refuse to acknowledge Policy, or become belligerent when presented with facts or asked to hold off while an official response is obtained, I'd rather do it myself.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't do it all myself btw, there is a greater variety of people editing now than ever before, certainly from earlier this year.  The current work being done is absolutely a collaboration, and with me it has always been a collaboration, but there just weren't that many people willing to put in the effort to address the problems of the site as a whole when it was KP, and still very few now.  It's a lot of work, but the results are paying off.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of what I consider productive collaboration:
https://gswiki.play.net/Talk:Web<em>(118)
https://gswiki.play.net/Gswiki:Requests#Adding</em>prices<em>and</em>INSPECT<em>info</em>to<em>NPC</em>Shop<em>inventory
https://gswiki.play.net/List</em>of<em>creatures</em>that<em>can</em>cause<em>item</em>loss

https://gswiki.play.net/Template<em>talk:Spell#Healing</em>Spells
https://gswiki.play.net/Help:Festshop<em>script
https://gswiki.play.net/Category:Automated</em>Unlocking_Certificates</p>

<p>Please let me know if you wish specifics on why in any of the examples as I know not everyone will know what to look for (see edit histories, talk pages to start; with the Slack and email being used regularly, histories and talk will not always have the full details).</p></div></article><article id="post-4407" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 12:29:42 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>As someone who has no knowledge of..Wiki-ing, is there a source we could use to gain insight into how youd like things done, or some kind of help page or 'beginner's guide'?

<p>The first page anyone should read is: https://gswiki.play.net/Help:Contents </p>

<p>https://gswiki.play.net/Template:Characterprofile
a good example: https://gswiki.play.net/Rohese_Bayvel-Timsh%27l</p>

<p>For past storylines I strongly recommend getting all the text you want into a Word or Google Doc file.  When the content is ready, we'll decide together the best format for it.  You might find that as you put the content together that it dictates the format, or you might find that you start one way, then completely move everything around. The less code there is before the text is where you want it, the easier it is to work with.</p>

<p>For ongoing storylines you can see what GM Kenstrom is doing here:
https://gswiki.play.net/Keeping<em>up</em>with<em>the</em>Kestrels</p>

<p>This was also done as an ongoing, but the story was much more focused in purpose, and a lot of organizational information was known beforehand, like how many days it would last, the major player characters involved, and the scope:
https://gswiki.play.net/Palestra<em>Trials</em>5116</p>

<p>You have people with more than one article of experience willing to answer your questions. Please take advantage of that via the Village Pump and the Request pages or email.</p>

<p>https://gswiki.play.net/Category:Help</p>

<p>These are all of the help pages that have been approved since the transfer to GSWiki. Some templates also have detailed help. Writing full instruction pages is extremely time consuming, and other things to do have to be ignored while they are written.</p></div></article><article id="post-4415" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 2:10:10 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@evarin said in <a href="/post/4412">Official: Wiki Moderation and Management</a>:</p>

<p>@Evarin Yes, we have spoken, and at the end of the conversation you clearly indicated you understood the reasons for my directness (mainly time). Since then we have had numerous interactions on Slack that I would characterize as far less than hostile.  We have conversations going back to 2008 that are very friendly, I don't know why you ever thought I was taking any personal shots at you to begin with, given our decade long history. </p>

<p>You got extremely upset when I pointed out that you didn't play anymore and were out of touch with the current state of sorcery when you made a statement about lore training. I absolutely apologize if that made you think I didn't like you or respect you.  Given our decade long history and long discussions of topics such as scroll infusion, I thought I could give that feedback.  You still seem to be upset about it today.  But I have no regrets if my comment helped lead to your return. But that discussion had nothing to do with the Wiki, did not take place on a Wiki page, or have anything to do with any Wiki edits.</p>

<p>The discussion here and the Officials has been far from unanimous. I cannot hold everyone's hand, I teach people to fish, as Wyrom stated.  </p>

<p>If you require further assistance, you simply don't indicate it when you do.  Last week when you needed assistance you were so impatient that you deleted your Slack message by the time I returned to the office from lunch.  You don't use the Talk pages, you don't use the Village Pump.</p></div></article><article id="post-4418" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 3:14:57 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm not buying that there's no time to be polite when speaking to people.

<p>I could go through and pick out the sentence structure and word choices used, but i'm not a linguist and I doubt the effort would be fruitful. If our past conversations, after having kept a record and reviewing them hasn't illuminated the issue, along with my several posts here and the sentiments expressed by several others across the 3 separate message boards haven't been able to make this point clear, I doubt anything I can say or do will. At this point, any further attempts to resolve the issue in the frame of our specific conversations will come off as a personal attack, which is not my intention nor is at all productive. </p>

<p>I entered this discussion because there was a theme being repeated. It wasn't to pile on, but to point out where the issue lies. Person A had an interaction with you which resulted in a negative outcome sufficient enough to be remembered, and at some point be brought up to you or others. Person B has a similar experience with a variation on that theme, and so on and so on. You then dissect each conversation, looking for the specific instances of you offering slight. Typically, none is found because you're not going to swear at or outright belittle anyone. Still, there's a common denominator running throughout these interactions where the subtext of the discussion is a perception of conflict.  If this perception was only held by one, or a few individuals, it could be dismissed. Instead, the problem is significant enough that it has reared its head many times and you've had to defend yourself now, and I am sure multiple times in the past.</p>

<p>You speak of not having enough time to engage with people in a way which would alleviate this perception of friction. This leads me to believe that you have some understanding of what could be done to address the problem, but you chose not to do so. If that's the case, I would ask how much time have you spent in this most recent instance attempting to deal with this issue, coupled with the direct conversations, letters to staff, etc. I would suggest instead that the time be taken to insure interactions with others, especially those centering around correcting what you would believe is a mistake or shortcoming, does not result in a perpetuation of a negatively perceived or confrontational interaction. It may not seem like a worthwhile use of your time, but as you can observe, it may end up saving you a great deal further down the line.</p></div></article><article id="post-4427" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 8:54:07 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir said in <a href="/post/4422">Official: Wiki Moderation and Management</a>:</p>

<p>The information on the padding numbers is being worked on by staff so that it is clear.  The issue stemmed when you revised the template that had the old numbers on it.  The old numbers are still accurate numbers in the new system.  The difference is the service numbers, which is what @allereli and ZHOUY1 have been discussing on https://gswiki.play.net/Talk:Padding.

<p>I did not remove the old numbers.  I simply added the service numbers along side of them so they would be accessible.  There is nothing in the wiki policy stating that players cannot edit pages created by staff.  If that is the policy then they should all be locked to prevent non-mods from touching them.  As for the rest of it, I don't think we need to have another discussion about how I feel about @allereli and her moderation practices.

<p>I'm having a difficult time seeing how the draft tag would be any different than the research pages, so it seems more like what's being offered are just more round holes.  Rarely is the solution to people not taking a path to add more paths.</p>

<p>Overall, It sounds like the best answer is that if official information should only be edited by officials, then only officials (GM's) should have permission to edit it.  A more robust permission scheme would be best.</p></div></article><article id="post-4539" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 12:35:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If we limit pages to ONLY be edited by GameMasters or a specific group of editors, we'll fall right back into the pitfall of the Krakiipedia.

<p>This makes my eyes bleed, but I definitely would not miss it on a page.</p>

<p>I'm also wondering, in the age of "pretty" webdesign. Has anyone considered using button-links on the main page? </p>

<p>Something like "Want to contribute?" "Latest Pages" "Style Guide" and whatever you felt was the most important? 
This is something I'd be more than happy to help with, if you thought it would be useful. I know, from a design perspective that if a page contains % more copy over imagery, you tend to lose a lot of readers out of sheer internet-ADHD. </p>

<p>Notice anything? For example, like the part where you send my name and physical location to someone outside the company in plain goddamned text? No SSL headers, No ESMTPS headers. There is no E2E. No TPL. No encryption whatsoever. And you're sending it through to random people who do not work for your company. Do you see the problem with this?</p>

<p>Is there any defense you can come up with that in the last 20 years, not a single employee at Simutronics was able to take the time to go to a search engine and type "how to install SSL on a server"?</p>

<p>Because you're sending this in plain text with zero security to someone you can't verify, from someone you can't verify, you sent both my information and her information flying through wherever with no encryption at all. So if I were looking for a person named, and I'll change the names for safety here, but if I were looking for a person named..let's say, Schmernessa within a half a mile radius of longitude XXXXX latitude XXXXX in XXXXX, Simutronics just made that possible. (You're welcome for X'ing that out.)</p>

<p>Get your shit together. </p>

<p>In this case both,  but the headers include my first initial and last name and IP address, sent plain text.</p>

<p>There are no wild accusations being thrown around when we're talking about "encrypt your email server". It's a security standard and has been for 20 years or more. There's no "so you're saying". Encrypt the mail server. It's not hard. It's not costly. It's on virtually every email server that exists for every company these days. Hell, you'd be hard pressed to find a server that's offered without it. You're sending personal information. To someone outside the company. Encrypt your mail server. In fact, I don't know the law, but I'd go so far as to say that it's probably illegal to NOT encrypt a mail server sending personal information from a company you've given it to.</p></div></article><article id="post-4596" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 9:18:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage </p>

<p>The problem with a plain text authenticated but not encrypted doesn't really lie solely with what gets sent to the receiving mail server. That part I should say is me just not wanting Simutronics to share my name and location with someone outside of the company.</p>

<p>The mail server sending the mail though is authenticated but not encrypted. Now that could mean one of two things. First, it's authenticating every email sent via a set up email address @play.net which forwards messages along via the wiki, and only passes in plain text the username and password for that @play.net account. I can say for certain that this isn't entirely the case and that it is paging at least some information from the sending wiki account because the headers included allereli@gmail.com through a mail sent via play.net, which suggests that that's her email address on file via the wiki. The second scenario is that it's authenticating both the sending wiki account and that @play.net email account in order to send a message through the wiki. Now, since your wiki account is the same as your play.net account, it means the following information is being sent plain text through an unencrypted mail server:</p>

<p>Scenario 1: @play.net email username and password. This could be a username specifically for sending mail through the wiki, and hopefully is, or it could be David Whatley's personal email address. Not saying that's the case, but just as an example. I've seen IT people use their own email addresses in back end sendmails though. I'm not gonna try to go hacking anything to find out what that exact account is because I'm not an idiot, but that's the long and the short of what can be snooped. </p>

<p>Scenario 2: If both sending wiki account and @play.net email are authenticated through that plain text on the server, a person's username and password to the wiki, and subsequently to their play.net account could be snooped, revealing that person's full name, address, phone number, and whatever other information Simutronics stores in its account profile. Probably not credit card. Those do have to be encrypted by law. S'why you can only see the last four digits most places. </p>

<p>In either scenario, there are usernames and passwords being sent via plain text that can be snooped. </p>

<p>It's a security loophole, and one that's not difficult or expensive to fix since there have been standard solutions available for 20+ years. If Ordim wants to call me crazy for pointing out a security loophole in a company that until 2016 didn't require you to type your correct password to login (case sensitive didn't matter, if you recall), then yeah, I'm crazy as hell. I'd be willing to bet those old passwords were sent to the server plain text too until they fixed it.</p>

<p>Web security isn't a joke when you're dealing with people's personal information.</p></div></article><article id="post-4622" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 11:24:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Another quick glance, have there been changes to material properties?

The wiki logins are SSL, https://gswiki.play.net/Main_Page so your login info is more likely than not being encrypted when you login to the wiki. Your local IP address is in the header because your mail host delivers it to your computer or a phone at your local IP address and tags that on the header, it doesn't exist until it has been "sent" from your mail provider to a device you own. So unless you are hosting your own mail server, at your own home address (physical and IP) AND you are using your first initial full last name as your email address, there is no one else to blame but yourself.

<p>there actually is a link in the left sidebar (there's that left sidebar again) when you go to a user page, whether content exists on that page or not, to email a user through the wiki.

</blockquote>

<p>GM Finros:
I'm afraid that the answer to this question isn't entirely straightforward. Modern items are built with inherent (Category A) material properties, including for "fancy materials". Older items may have used scripts for material properties before the materials were formalized. And aside from that, even some modern "materials" are still scripts in various forms -- for example, "pure black ora" is a script while regular black ora is a standard material. In any case, the three examples you named are modern materials with inherent properties.</p>

<p>With regard to flares, my listing of Category B flares was complete with nothing missing. All other flares are scripts (which may or may not use the Category B slot as part of the flare script); additionally, there may be variants on the Category B flares ("greater X flares") that are actually scripts.</p></div></article><article id="post-4806" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 2:25:21 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli I just finished the armor and shields so it should be done.</p></div></article><article id="post-4807" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Tei</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 3:11:27 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There are some "precious" people playing this game.

<blockquote>
  <p>All I really want is some recourse when the mods are out of line. Right now the feeling is once a mod starts pushing you around you might as well go pound sand. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I replied at fair length on the wiki's Talk page of the template in question (since that's where this started) about the specific situation there. But to elaborate a little on that and then on some general items:</p>

<p>If something you put on the wiki is rolled back, or edited, or you're requested to edit in a specific way by any of the moderators -- the moderator is simply doing his/her job (i.e. moderating information of the wiki for both style and accuracy). If you want to discuss why that happened with the moderator, there's a Talk page for each page. You can also note -- politely and remaining within policies -- that you disagree with the edit. Just because you disagree with the edit doesn't make you "right" though.</p>

<p>If you've gone through the good faith communication channels, and you still feel that a moderator is out of line, then email both myself and Wyrom. Include a link to the relevant wiki pages and Talk pages involved. If some of the "talk" was done in the Slack wiki channel, include reference to that as well.</p>

<p>What you should NOT do is decide that you are the moderator's moderator. Re-rolling back a moderator's rollbacks and/or creating a "bypass" to essentially continue those rolled-back edits elsewhere is not an appropriate course of action. It's like going into a restaurant kitchen and taking the skillet out of the chef's hand -- so that you can cook the dish yourself -- because you don't like the recipe he's using for a particular dish, despite the fact that he's responsible for maintaining the restaurant's recipe standards and was cooking the dish in a manner that followed those -- i.e. that's not good behavior in any realm of reality.</p>

<p>What you should NOT do is decide that it's then also appropriate to throw that moderator to the wolves in a public forum. I have no appropriate analogy for this. But I am going to elaborate a little bit on the other side of things. I realize that people get personally invested in all of this (and I absolutely know and understand how time consuming some wiki edits are), but the amount of vulgarity and insults I've seen thrown at moderators in private communication sent to them for simply trying to do their jobs -- without those moderators ever responding in kind and yet somehow attempting to continue to work with these people -- is pretty disgraceful. Most wiki complaints that come in are people taking an edit personally rather than stepping back and looking at that what they had edited doesn't fit with the wiki style, or was against policy, or was inaccurate information, or was creating a ton of spam pages, etc. -- i.e. all things that moderators are meant to look at and attempt to correct. Moderators also suffer from that they don't have the shield of a Host or GM handle to help the players separate out their moderator responsibilities from their opinions/behaviors as a player and person -- and yet sometimes it seems like the playerbase forgets that the moderators are, in fact, people.</p>

<p>In this specific instance, the moderator in question (Allereli) rolled back the change and gave a specific reason for it, which she later elaborated on -- she was waiting to get some information confirmed on what was previously officially approved info. All you had to do was be patient until that info was confirmed. Your edits weren't lost -- they were still available in the History and could have easily been pulled out after the confirmation took place. Given that the page is a template used for several other pages and is part of a system that just underwent a major overhaul, it makes perfect sense that a moderator was and is keeping tabs on it.</p>

<p>While you may not like the answer that you're getting about this, the reality is that the moderators exist to do a specific type of work, and they're doing it. It's a lot of tedious work and dealing with a lot of different personalities. Allereli handles a massive amount of it, and yet she also manages to try and let people know when she's changed something they did and attempts to bridge editing knowledge gaps when possible. When she reaches out about wiki info/editing/etc., she's trying to help you, even if you aren't reading her words that way. The big thing here is that communication only works if all parties are engaging and understand where each party is coming from. Can we (the collective we) improve on how some of the communication for wiki work goes? Absolutely. It's a work in progress, and clearly the moderators are already well aware of that and regularly working on it (thus, items like the Research pages coming into existence).</p>

<p>In saying all of this, I also don't want to discount the huge number of people who help out with the wiki. A lot of of people show patience and compassion, and regularly communicate with the mods and with one another to see what needs to be done or ask how to do something so that it's fitting the wiki style, where you can contribute, etc. -- and that makes life go a lot more smoothly in wiki world.</p>
