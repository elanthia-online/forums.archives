<li>You will need a fishing pole, fishing line, and bait, all of which can be found in the Fishing Shack down on the pier in Caligos Isle, though you’re not required to purchase items from this shop - ANY fishing pole/wire/bait will function the same.</li>
<li>Source - Haliste</li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect the word FUNCTION only refers to the ABILITY to use the system.  Any pole/wire/bait will allow you to use the system.  </p>

<p>Some wire is stronger than others, as evidenced by the strong wire being more expensive in the Fishing Shack.  I suspect that some poles may be stronger than others, but I don't have a good way to test this.  There is some speculation that the fishing rod that was found in Delirium Manor is stronger than others.</p>

<p>|Getting a fish on the line.|
|---------------------------------|</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a seasonal bonus, it’s better to fish in the spring and summer. Fall is neutral. Winter has a penalty. This isn’t really suppose to be revealed, but given seasons aren’t the same across the world, these seasons are reflected on the United States.
  Source - Wyrom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are in the Fall season, so we do not get this bonus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are bonuses to fishing during certain hours of the day. This isn’t meant to be revealed. It’s not a random thing.
  Source - Wyrom
  Source - Wyrom: It's a random bonus, but everyone gets it.  So for example.  The bonus can be +1d5 during a certain time of the day.  Everyone gets the bonus during that time, but Bob might get +3 and you might get +5
  Source - Wyrom: This is per attempt too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe the bonus associated with time is related to the messaging found in the time verb.  At "It is currently afternoon" there is going to be a bonus at X depth &amp; X distance.  Since it is not random, you can mostly likely change your depth &amp; distance throughout the day to take advantage of this bonus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>time
  Today is Niiman, day 12 of the month Jastatos in the year 5117.  It is 14:10 by the elven time standard.  It is currently afternoon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>|I am unable to track this properly, as most people use RAISE 100% of the time.  We need people to try different depths &amp; distances to get an accurate idea of this bonus.|
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|<strong>I cannot see if you use a weight or not, I can only see your distance and time.  If you want to help with this, a post saying I'll be using/not using (this) weight from X-hour to X-hour would be helpful.</strong>|</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are bonuses for the area you’re fishing in (is it a good/hot spot).
  Source - Wyrom
  Question - Are you talking about towns (Landing vs Icemule vs EG) when you say area or distance &amp; depth?
  Answer - No. I’m talking about if the area is set up to be a hot spot. This is something a GM does.
  Source - Wyrom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would guess that the EG fishing pool is a good/hot spot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your lure has a bonus as long as it’s used in the right depth of water.
  Source - Wyrom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bait only appears to determine when a fish will nibble at a specific depth, the bait sold in the Fishing Shack functions at all depths so you should always receive this bonus.</p></div></article><article id="post-6380" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 12th, 2017, 2:13:26 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>|Reeling it in!|

<blockquote>
  <p>Once the fish is on your line, there are a new set of checks.
  The only stat that is used in strength.
  Bigger fish are harder to catch from having an inherited strength bonus.
  Source - Wyrom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every fish is going to have X weight.  Your strength vs the weight of the fish appears to determine whether you will be successful in catching the fish. I suspect that some fish will always snap lines because of their weight. I didn't begin to log weight until just recently, but here are some of the ranges I have.  If you catch a fish outside of these weight ranges, that is very important information, please post it along with your strength stat and bonus.</p>

<p>|<strong>If you would like to assist in this project, weigh the fish BEFORE you cut it and post the results here, along with your strength STAT and BONUS.</strong>|

  <p>look rod
  Judging by the rather frantic, tiny twitches from the line, you can tell your lure is skimming the surface of the water.
  The well-maintained yew wood of the expertly crafted rod is polished to a high sheen.  Marbled grey leather is wound tightly around the handle for a firm grip.  Looking closely at the side of the reel you see a detailed engraving of a dragon in flight.  Etched along the rod in elegant script are the words "Ord and Dragan."</p>
