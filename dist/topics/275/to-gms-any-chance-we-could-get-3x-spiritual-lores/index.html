<p>I've been wondering about this for months for too many reasons to go into right now, but right now what's on my mind are the MIU changes. If there's a 0% chance of being able to change any training caps for any profession, I'd at least be glad to hear a straight answer on that... But just to explain what I'm thinking in case there's even a slim possibility:</p>

<p>At first the Spike Thorn item in Duskruin had me excited, and I did buy one, but now it makes me sad the longer I think about it. If I were playing a sorceress, sure, I could sink 150-200 ranks into Summoning and have a blast with that item all while not (at least as far as I know) sacrificing any power in sorcerer base or any profession-defining abilities because of my lore choices.</p>

<p>Instead I'm playing a cleric, though, and even if I fixskilled specifically for this item there's no way my character who's a master of spiritual magic could be as good as a sorceress at using a spiritual item containing a spiritual spell that benefits from spiritual lores. At least not unless I decided to give up profession-defining abilities like full chrisms and intercession.</p>

<p>Then add on top of it that sorcerers have 2x elemental lores and empaths have 2x mental lores, so they have two spheres of magical items to use, and it seems like clerics (and wizards) got the short end of the stick with these MIU changes.</p>

<p>I'm fine with only benefiting from one lore sphere, but then I at least want to be noticeably better at that one sphere than the hybrid spiritual professions. Which 3x lores would demonstrate!</p></div></article><article id="post-2575" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Destrier</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 12:36:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>-stare-   rangers have spike thorn innate and have 1x lores and have to choose between Summoning or Blessing or suck at both.</p>

<p>Rangers (and all other professions) can pretty easily use two of a cleric's best innate spells, Bravery and Heroism, via items and scrolls. Even with 0 Blessings they get 40 AS while a typical cleric would get 46 or 48 (at thresholds for full chrisms or group 219), so a ranger basically makes use of these two spells almost exactly as well as a cleric would. And I don't have any issue with that.</p>

<p>As for 616, I don't want a cleric to be able to use Spike Thorn as well as a ranger, just as well as a sorcerer or empath. While we don't know exactly how MIU works with 616, I'd imagine that even a cleric who went all the way to the extreme and pushed Summoning to 303 ranks wouldn't compare to an equally post-cap ranger who was full 2x spells, due to indoor penalties (which is almost every post-cap area) and no benefits from overtraining ranger base.</p>

<p>@Flimbo </p>

<p>Believe me, there are lots of training caps I'd love to see reevaluated. In an earlier draft I even started listing them out, but deleted them because it's beyond the scope of the thread...</p>

<p>@allereli </p>

<p>Disappointing, I would have wanted that for wizards too.</p>

<p>@idlewanderlust </p>

<p>Ranger base is spiritual--635 gets the full CS bonus from charges of 340.</p>

<p>(In fact, 635 is probably the best beneficiary of 340 and I'm not sure anything even comes close. If chrism holders are ever sold off the shelf again, watch out...)</p></div></article><article id="post-2652" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Destrier</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 4:09:53 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Bravery and heroism are a share sphere between Empaths and Clerics.  Not exclusive to clerics nor the best innate cleric spells IMO.</p>

<p>Since hardly any of us use 635 regularly because we kill players.  Using 340 on the rare times it is used, seems a bit of a stretch compared to selling rangers signature attack spell to any with BS and then asking for a change to Lore for an entire profession to use said item better.</p>

<p>Guess I should petition for 20x raise dead rods, and 2x lore? </p>

<p>Chism holders only are also not holy symbols.  Unless I am missing how you plan on using it.  But a chism is not used for 340, a holy symbol is, with limited charges.</p>

<p>Having been told flat out at Simucon, nothing is going on for rangers.  You are going to have to pardon my reluctance on seeing my profession reduced to casting mass hues and mobility.  Oh wait, those are available on scrolls and items also.  </p>

<p>Guess it does not matter anymore, enjoy Gemstone.</p>

Not many know that, but try it with the recent ones from Delirium Manor if you still have any. (Not counting unaligned chrism holders, of course.)</p>

<p>For everything else you said... I'm not going to defend my stances on 211 or 215 or anything else further, though I could, because I respect you and I don't want to miss the forest for the trees by disputing every little thing. Here's the forest:</p>

<p>I completely understand not liking your spell being given away, but it's already been given away for two professions. If I had picked an empath or sorcerer on the profession screen, I wouldn't be here posting that I'd like to be better at using the new 616 item--instead I'd already be using it with 160 Summoning.</p>

<p>Also, I want to stress that the 616 item isn't my only reason and definitely not my top reason for wanting 3x lores. I went with that because it was topical and maybe that was a mistake. I'll name two others:</p>

<p>1 - Clerics (and wizards) run out of post-cap goals more quickly than empaths and sorcerers due to only benefiting from a single sphere of lore, so I'd like something else to train.</p>

<p>2 - Empaths with 1x lore have a stronger and cheaper single-target kill spell (based on <a href="https://gswiki.play.net/Research:Mean_casts_per_kill_(317,_519,_1115">this</a>)) than clerics with 2x lore, so we should have advantages in other areas like the 100s and 200s circles.</p></div></article><article id="post-2697" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Methais</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 6:50:11 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@leafiara said in <a href="/post/2544">To GMs: Any chance we could get 3x spiritual lores?</a>:</p>

<p>Yeah, this could work too. The only thing that makes me waver is that it does sacrifice character uniqueness since people would eventually make their way to 2x everything, though.

<p>That example is for an outside spell though.  Estild has posted that native should bypass Miu entirely (otherwise Wizards and sorcs should be Imbedding their lesser elemental spells from now on). </p>

<p>Yeah, I did the math and it comes out to about... 6 points more.  however, I think it ALSO means that unless the sorc or wizard is trained for Minor Elemental, the cleric or empath with 2x MIU is better than them at the few Warding spells in the 400's.  However, Non-professional spells are generally considered less protected.  500's is the oddball, but since most wizards train it as a primary sphere they'll be better than outsides.  But I don't know how this might change things around with 917 etc.</p>

<p>At any rate, to what you're trying, confirm it before you buy.</p></div></article><article id="post-3855" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ceph</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 3:05:56 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If chrism holders are ever sold off the shelf again, watch out...)</p>
