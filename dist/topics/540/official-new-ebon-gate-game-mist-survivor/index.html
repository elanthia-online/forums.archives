<p>Hey Everyone! </p>

<p>I'm pleased to announce a new game that will be available for Ebon Gate.</p>

<p>Welcome to THE MIST SURVIVOR!</p>

<p>The objective is simple, survive. Once started, all participants
have 60 seconds to enter and get ready before the game starts.
All participants will slowly gain counters of mist poisoning.
Gain too many, and you will lose. The winner is decided by the
last person to leave the crypt by climbing out on the exit rope.
The game ends when the last person leaves the crypt; by force,
or by climbing out.</p>

<p>GAME MECHANICS
TRAPS - Participants will be able to search the area within
and find strange traps and wands they can use against
other participants.
AIR POCKETS - Participants have a chance when SEARCHing to find
clean pockets of air. There is also a chance to find
poisonous mist pockets.
EXIT ROPE - There is only one way out. The exit rope changes rooms
frequently and has a chance to be gone from the area
for short periods of time.
MIST COUNTERS - Participants gain poisonous mist counters periodically
throughout the game. There is also a chance to
critically fail and earn double the mist counters.
In addition, you will also receive negative status
effects on a critical fail.
PRIZES - There will be Prizes.</p>

<p>Big thanks to the following GMs in helping getting this ready in time!
Elidi, Haliste, Wyrom, Tamuz, Thandiwe, Flanihan, Kynlee</p>

<p>PS - You must listen to Eye of the Tiger or Beyonce Survivor while playing.</p>

<p>Retser, ASGM</p>
