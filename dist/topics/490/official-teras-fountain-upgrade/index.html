<p>Word reached the Prince that local bards have been risking unpleasant death by dehydration due to the lack of easily accessible water on the Isle. Feeling that life on Teras is risky enough, he sent forth the local janitor/handyman to do some upgrades. Eldalina visited today and confirmed that the water is cool, fresh, delicious, and not poisoned!</p>

<p>OOC information:</p>

<p>The fountain at Dragonspine and Krodera has been updated to offer fresh drinking water! Simply DIP FOUNTAIN with an appropriate drinking vessel in your hand, and enjoy. Note that the souvenir glasses from this past summer's festival work quite nicely!</p>

<p>In the interest of keeping even the smallest of the town's residents safe and happy, the goldfish, formerly residing in a shallow pool on Ghorsa Isle, has been relocated, and the pool filled.</p>

<p>Dwarven engineers worked on the fountain at Dragonspine and Krodera during the wee hours, installing an aquarium of sorts in the granite of the fountain's base. The fish will be happy and safe behind thick glass. The water is auto-filtered, and town workers will see that it is fed.</p>

<p>Please enjoy watching the little fellow by LOOKing at the fountain, or at the window. The goldfish itself is BEHIND the window, of course. You can also TAP and LEAN on the window, but there's no telling what an annoyed goldfish will think of you, should you do that.</p>
