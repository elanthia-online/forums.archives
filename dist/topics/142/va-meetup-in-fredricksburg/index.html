<p>Let me know if you'd like to come but can't make specific dates, I can try to plan around it.</p>

<p>Would rather the discussion take place on the PC, but you can reply here if you really don't want to go there.</p>

<p>I've been there a dozen times or more.  It's a very wide open area, but no special rooms.  I'm hoping to "reserve" a corner of the restaurant, though.  We probably won't have anything like real privacy, but we should be comfortable.  I've never been there and seen it more than half full (it really is a pretty sizeable area).  Friday evenings it might be a bit more crowded, which is why I'm planning on stopping in and seeing if I can make arrangements for us.</p>

<p>Of note:  They close at 10 on Friday nights.  I'm not sure if we want to have a second destination in mind?  Maybe something akin to a 'bar'?  Just thinking out loud here...</p>

<p>Of Second note:  They have a 20% off coupon on their website for any dinner only orders that surpass $40.00.  I'll probably print out one of these for everyone, as that's a pretty healthy deal.</p></div></article><article id="post-4959" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 12th, 2017, 8:43:27 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@0zymandius I'm good with drinks afterwards.</p></div></article><article id="post-4962" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 12th, 2017, 9:05:52 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage said in <a href="/post/4959">VA meetup in Fredricksburg</a>:</p>

<p>There's an O'Charley's (*which I have never been to in my life) that shares a parking lot with Peter Chang's, and advertises itself has having a full bar.  Gets halfway decent ratings, too.  Seems like a slam dunk there.  (Note:  O'Charley's is only open until 11, but not sure if we're going to want to be out and about any later than that.  Quite a few of us have a drive afterwards.)</p></div></article><article id="post-4963" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 12th, 2017, 9:17:25 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Drink are pretty hard to mess up, looks like most of the real bars are near the Rappahannock River.</p></div></article><article id="post-4964" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 12th, 2017, 9:20:26 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage said in <a href="/post/4963">VA meetup in Fredricksburg</a>:</p>

<p>Hell to the no. You'd have to get me some real life rewards to even get me to consider that level of activity.</p>

<p>Edited to add: I work retail... You have no idea the amount of running around I have to do on a REGULAR basis to begin with.</p></div></article><article id="post-6433" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 13th, 2017, 11:56:44 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Lol well those that wanted to do the 5k could (optional) and we would have an additional decadent breakfast outing</p></div></article><article id="post-6436" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 13th, 2017, 1:22:07 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Can you PM us the name the reservation is under?</p></div></article><article id="post-6437" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 13th, 2017, 1:30:32 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>He already said Daniel, I think.</p></div></article><article id="post-6438" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 13th, 2017, 1:35:26 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There could be others!

<p>Heh, I had my 30th birthday party there. It's not the best D&amp;B, but it gets the job done.

<p>+1 to this.  A full day of D&amp;B and perhaps some bar hopping afterward I'd make the trip to Richmond.  Probably stay the night somewhere, 3.5 hour trek for me from up north.</p></div></article><article id="post-6509" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, October 14th, 2017, 10:44:18 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm fairly certain we can make this a thing.
