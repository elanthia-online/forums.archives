<p>Write, for example, "The night is shattered</p>

<p>and the blue stars shiver in the distance."</p>

<p>The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.</p>

<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.</p>

<p>I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.</p>

<p>Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.</p>

<p>I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.</p>

<p>She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.</p>

<p>How could one not have loved her great still eyes.</p>

<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.</p>

<p>To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.</p>

<p>To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.</p>

<p>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.</p>

<p>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.</p>

<p>The night is shattered and she is not with me.</p>

<p>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.</p>

<p>My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.</p>

<p>My sight searches for her as though to go to her.</p>

<p>My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.</p>

<p>The same night whitening the same trees.</p>

<p>We, of that time, are no longer the same.</p>

<p>I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.</p>

<p>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.</p>

<p>Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.</p>

<p>Her voice. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.</p>

<p>I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.</p>

<p>Love is so short, forgetting is so long.</p>

<p>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms</p>

<p>my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.</p>

<p>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer</p>

<p>and these the last verses that I write for her.</p>

I love you directly without problems or pride: 
I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love, 
except in this form in which I am not nor are you, <br />
so close that your hand upon my chest is mine, <br />
so close that your eyes close with my dreams.</p>

<p>A classic.</p></div></article><article id="post-6777" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Necios</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 19th, 2017, 10:04:51 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Sabotage that's so sweet, I love you too!! wait a minute...</p></div></article><article id="post-6778" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 19th, 2017, 10:09:44 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@necios <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SwLPg5w.gif" alt="alt text" title="" /></p></div></article><article id="post-6779" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Necios</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 19th, 2017, 10:14:18 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage Me gustas cuando callas, porque estás como austente.

his golden feet?
I reply, the ocean knows this.
You say, what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparent 
bell? What is it waiting for?
I tell you it is waiting for time, like you.
You ask me whom the Macrocystis alga hugs in its arms?
Study, study it, at a certain hour, in a certain sea I know.
You question me about the wicked tusk of the narwhal, 
and I reply by describing
how the sea unicorn with the harpoon in it dies.
You enquire about the kingfisher's feathers,
which tremble in the pure springs of the southern tides?
Or you've found in the cards a new question touching on 
the crystal architecture
of the sea anemone, and you'll deal that to me now?
You want to understand the electric nature of the ocean 
spines?
The armored stalactite that breaks as it walks?
The hook of the angler fish, the music stretched out
in the deep places like a thread in the water?</p>

<p>I want to tell you the ocean knows this, that life in its 
jewel boxes
is endless as the sand, impossible to count, pure,
and among the blood-colored grapes time has made the 
petal
hard and shiny, made the jellyfish full of light
and untied its knot, letting its musical threads fall
from a horn of plenty made of infinite mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>I am nothing but the empty net which has gone on ahead
of human eyes, dead in those darknesses,
of fingers accustomed to the triangle, longitudes
on the timid globe of an orange.</p>

<p>I walked around as you do, investigating
the endless star,
and in my net, during the night, I woke up naked,
the only thing caught, a fish trapped inside the wind.</p>
