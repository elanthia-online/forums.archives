<p>We are still waiting to see how EG plays out to begin with, with the tiers.</p>

<p>Plus, there is also Festival of the Fallen next week!</p></div></article><article id="post-4530" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">LivderaDeralleur</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 11:47:30 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Because I now have a Monk alt that I've grown rather fond of, I've added padded robes and cool UAC boots/gloves to the "Wanted" list.

Potentially 4x HCP robes would be something I'd be definitely interested in. Not a huge rush, either, as my Monk can't hold 4x as of yet.</p></div></article><article id="post-5415" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">LivderaDeralleur</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 25th, 2017, 2:28:49 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Adding "silvers" in the Wanted column, so I'll be willing to take offers in silvers for some of the stuff I have.

<p>FYI - I have Lich working now, so I'm usually on Bara, Hildegarde or my Hardcore alt Lucille. Email is livdera@gmail.com. The chat function here is a bit wonky, accessibility wise, so I'm forever worried I'm going to miss a message .... so email or in-game.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
