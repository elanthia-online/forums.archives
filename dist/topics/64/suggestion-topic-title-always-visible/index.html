<p>I'd like to have the current Topic always visible at the top of the page.  The reason is, when I click on a post either from the Unread Posts, or from the Notifications (bell thingie), it takes me directly to that individual post.  I'm not sure, at that point, what topic I'm actually looking at, and that could lead to confusion.  I know, because it confuses me.</p></div></article><article id="post-285" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 9:05:23 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Is this in regards to sticky-ing the topic title as you scroll down through X posts?  In addition to having the web browser identify the topic as the website?</p>

<p>Go for it.  If we need to revert because people cry, so be it.</p></div></article><article id="post-286" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 9:09:34 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I think he might be talking about where it shows Home > Suggestions &amp; Concerns > Suggestion: Topic title always visible?

<p>That part disappears as more posts appear.</p></div></article><article id="post-287" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 9:10:42 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Either/or, really.  Just some way to see, while scrolling, which topic I'm in.  The title at the top is nice and clear, but it vanishes.  If it could be stickied somehow, that'd be good, or if the path that Alastir mentioned could remain visible, either of those would work for me.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
