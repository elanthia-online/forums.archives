<p>On the fourth day of ESN, empaths gained the ability to share some of their learning with their patients through the bond temporarily shared between them by the act of healing. When empaths are awarded their experience from healing, the patient will also be awarded 20% percent of that amount as Long Term Experience up to a maximum of 250 LTE per day. For those curious, the goal of this update is to encourage players to seek out healers over the alternatives when possible.</p>

<p>Questions, concerns, joy, anger? Feel free to share!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One question - will this require an empathic link, or is the effect automatic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just automatic from transferring. Nothing special required.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm assuming this is the thing that was teased yesterday that the transfer effect was needed for, my first impression is to have mixed feelings about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the other hand, I can see some obnoxious twit coming in right as I'm trying log out for the night/track down a merchant/etc and demand I mess around with linking to them and waiting for them to get their exp...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure I understand what you're saying here. If you heal people, they will get LTE. There's nothing more complicated to it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if the patient is dead at the time of healing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shouldn't stop the patient from getting the LTE. :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a long-time primarily healing Empath, all I can say is.. WOOOOOOOWWWW...</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>if the person who generated the box is present in the room, the xp would go to them. If not, then oh well.</p></div></article><article id="post-7574" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">JNewhall</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 20th, 2017, 9:55:52 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli </p>

<p>That is a good idea, but I'm not sure it would get me to seek out player locksmiths, because the NPC locksmith is instantaneous.</p>

<p>I will probably seek out healers as a result of this change, because herbs, while fast, are not instantaneous. </p>

<p>I'm in favor of the idea, I just think it will be less efficacious than the current change to healing.</p></div></article><article id="post-7575" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 20th, 2017, 11:08:27 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@jnewhall said in <a href="/post/7574">Official: ESN - Rewards for Patients</a>:</p>

<p>The NPC also often costs more than the value of the contents of the box, and I think the charge should be increased. I use player locksmiths and rarely ever go to the town smith.</p>

<p>Would not mind the longterm exp bonus for using a player locksmith if they can solve the technical issue of determining who gets the exp, but pretty certain that would not be a silver bullet. That plus an RT reduction would dramatically shift it though.</p></div></article><article id="post-7577" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 20th, 2017, 12:33:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Waiting on locksmiths is painful.

<p>I agree. If RTs were reduced I would use player smiths more. LTE is much less important to me
than the RT issue.</p></div></article><article id="post-7579" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">JNewhall</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 20th, 2017, 1:07:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli said in <a href="/post/7575">Official: ESN - Rewards for Patients</a>:</p>
