<p>Definitely open for trade/sale. I figured I'd reach out to see if there's any interest. Considering my Plat character sucks hard at the arena and I haven't a hope at easily obtaining it, bloodscript would be nice to trade for and most preferred.</p>

<p>Heading to bed currently, but I'll be around tomorrow morning/afternoon.</p></div></article><article id="post-2317" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Hips</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 11:00:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You might want to talk to @Tain, I know he is looking into putting together a pendant!</p></div></article><article id="post-2433" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">LivderaDeralleur</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 19th, 2017, 10:18:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This is still available for trading, as I really don't have an interest in a pendant.</p>

<p>May be willing to trade for a set of padded brig (perhaps a set of the 6x HCP that was available last DR). Otherwise, some amount of Bloodscript (make an offer!)</p></div></article><article id="post-3199" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">LivderaDeralleur</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 2:39:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>FYI - I basically have all pieces to the rare moon now, including the golvern segment, so basically the whole moon is up for trade.

Thanks, but no. I'm aiming for brig as a natural stopping point while I slog my way towards aug chain. Heh.</p></div></article><article id="post-3290" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">TheLofe</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 9:55:43 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>if you intend to go to aug chain, I would highly recommend using chain mail as that natural stopping point.  You get brig protection on the head/legs/arms still, and chain on the torso.  That crit divisor and drop in DFs is a big jump.</p></div></article><article id="post-3295" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">LivderaDeralleur</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 11:15:42 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@TheLofe Hm.
