Once said scripts are finished, I'm going to be getting it altered.  Therein lies my issue.</p>

<p>In an effort to be as Zelia-approved as possible, most of my current alterations are based around 'interwoven', 'chaotic', 'tangled', etc.  What would, or should, a sack look like for a Zelia cleric?  It's just going to be my herb container, but I'm running dry on ideas.  Any advice or input?</p></div></article><article id="post-43" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ELVENRULE</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, July 31st, 2017, 9:24:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If you're going for a woven/tangled aspect, I might make a basket made out of some sort of sticks/twine.

long description "a pouch made of interwoven woth flower stems tightly arranged in a chaotically random pattern"
when shown: "The pouch seems sturdy enough, given that it's made solely out of interwoven stems of woth flower.  The stems have been woven into a chaotic pattern, but you can barely make out the outline of a crescent moon along its side."</p>

<p>Or something like that.  I am a little rusty.  Woth of course due to the "nervous system" restorative properties. :)</p></div></article><article id="post-339" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 11:49:02 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Oh, I LIKE that!
