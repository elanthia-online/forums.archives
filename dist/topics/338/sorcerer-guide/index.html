Thanks for the link. I remembered reading it, but thought it was unfinished. I was wondering if Whirlin had finished writing the guide or gave up due to what was being said to him.  Any rate. I guess I'll have to base my decisions off the information I can glean from what is written there.  I've found his guides spot on for other classes I've made. Too bad it never got finished.</p></div></article><article id="post-3399" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 26th, 2017, 10:32:39 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>It's more finishedish on the wiki.
