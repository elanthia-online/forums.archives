She lifted the brown leather satchel down from its hook and slung it over her shoulder to rest on her hip.  Opening the door to her cell, she headed down the corridor towards the Abbess’s office, nodding a greeting to a passing acolyte.</p>

<p>Preparations were well underway for the Elanthian Conclave later this year and it was time to spread the word. Stacked neatly on the desk were several piles of handwritten invitations.  Carial lifted a bundle and stowed them in her satchel.  Tying the flap closed, she headed over to the list pinned on the wall and ran her finger down the proposed guest list.</p>

<p>Memorizing several names, she went back into the main temple hallway, pausing only to murmur a prayer at one of the niches in the wall, and disappeared out into the sunlight.  </p>

The dutiful acolytes all filed silently into the temple but Priest Mandral loitered outside.  He murmured a quiet prayer to Ronan under his breath while he waited for the others.  Opening his eyes, he was perturbed to notice that Priestess Haedahl had appeared at his shoulder during his devotion.  He shuddered inwardly as she hissed sharply in his ear but was relieved to see both Carial and Liniane come around the corner.  Nodding a greeting to all three priestesses, he led them down the corridor to a small ante-chamber and closed the door.</p>

<p>In hushed tones, the four shared their progress with plans for the upcoming Elanthian Conclave.  Invitations had been delivered and many devotees were already reaching out to participate.  Their discussions were interrupted by Priest Ereker storming through the door.  His wild eyes scanned the room and, with a heavy sigh, he made his apologies for being late.  It was agreed that they should all venture out once more to spread the word.  Making a few notes in his diary, Mandral slipped it into a pocket inside his robe and bade them all farewell.</p>

His thoughts turned to the list of guest speakers for next week’s Conclave and he mentally ticked them all off in his head.   He hoped that the schedule would be of interest and  that the devoted would heed the call. </p>

<p>Priestess Carial paced in her cell.  Sleep had eluded her yet again.  With only a week to go, there was still so much to do.  In an effort to calm her nerves, she plucked at the petals of the deep pink rose in her hand and murmured a quiet orison to Oleani to bless all those who would be gathering with love and understanding.</p>

<p>Priest Ereker walked around the vast Rotunda, first in a clockwise direction, then counterclockwise; his wild eyes darting back and forth at the surrounding statuary.  While he enjoyed the solitude of an empty chamber, his mind was filled with a barrage of images: crowds of people milling around, the babble of debate and prayer, and he inwardly dreaded the week to come.</p>

<p>Priestess Haedahl slipped her hands into the sleeves of her robe and silently wandered the corridors.  Hearing someone slam a door behind her, she hissed sharply in their direction and continued her internal monologue. <em>One little lie, so many conveniences ...</em></p>

<p>Priestess Linaine slept peacefully.  Old age had its benefits and she seldom worried about mortal matters.  Oblivious to the concerns of her fellow clerics, she smiled in her sleep, the curve of her lips mirroring the sickle blade mounted behind her bunk.  Her cell was as silent as the grave.</p>
