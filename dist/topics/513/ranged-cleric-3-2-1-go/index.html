Got all those sanct arrows in TV to use and later on will do blessing with master fletched arrows.  If anyone is curious about this path and progress I will make posts every 5 levels after level 10 to everyone know my thoughts, see my training path etc.</p>

<p>One Caveat - I have a pocket wizard...so results may skew a little thanks to buffs keeping me safe</p></div></article><article id="post-5437" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 26th, 2017, 11:10:11 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The one thing that kept me from going this path is that I've tried a couple times with both wizard and bard to make a non-standard (rogue/ranger/warrior) archer, and the ability to only single train in Ranged just made me crazy.  My AS was never high enough to 'do' it correctly, it felt like.</p>

<p>That said, I've seen plenty of people who swear by archer warmages (Hi Whirlin!), and bards are theoretically pretty awesome at it, too.  I just never had much luck.</p>

<p>All of which is to say 'Yes, I'd be interested to see how this progresses, thanks!'</p></div></article><article id="post-5438" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">BriarFox</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 26th, 2017, 11:38:40 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Should be all right for awhile with the AS buffs from 211, 215, and 307, plus society abilities. Might want to do Voln so you get the extra AS against undead, but non-corp undead do suck for ranged. Keep us posted.</p></div></article><article id="post-5439" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 26th, 2017, 11:48:39 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>It will last until your 40s, probably... at which point TDs begin to normalize, and CS attacks really start to take over as a incredibly effective, viable attack form.  It'll help you out with minimal mana on the short term.  But a long term strategy?  Nah.</p>

<p>Also, dunno about what arrows you picked up, but you need magical blessed to hit critters in Reim, if that was a consideration.</p></div></article><article id="post-5446" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ashraam VanEyre</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 26th, 2017, 1:54:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Just make sure you have enough spell ranks to ward successfully, so you can use 301 on undead and another disable (118 maybe) on the living in order to keep your AS viable.  Also, you could consider a mechanical crossbow.  The attack speed is 1-2 seconds slower than a bow (properly trained), but you can abuse the +30 AS from kneeling as a cleric with 319.</p></div></article><article id="post-5448" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 26th, 2017, 2:56:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I was going to master fletch for Reim and yes I had planned on Voln for sure.
