Free slips Thursday evening if you help out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey everyone, sometime Thursday evening, we're going to open the arena up for some beta runs. We'll be giving out some slips to those that do some beta testing. We mostly want you to to team up during this, but doing some solo matches will be cool too. If you help beta test, you'll get to keep everything you earn plus get some slips when the event opens Friday evening! We will have a pile out, but we're going to be monitoring it this time so that no one is loading up alts with tons of free slips. See you soon!</p>

I wouldn't mind joining a group of L20ish characters with my Bard. I am new to Plat, so she is my only character currently.</p>

<p>I wonder if we will technically be "grouped" in the Arena with the 2v2 and 3v3? Technically my Bard spellsongs could be useful to others at that point.</p></div></article><article id="post-1979" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 12:26:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I think we will!

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't have an exact time for testing/sneak peak. Thursday later in the evening is all I can really say.</p>
  
  <p>It will be the same pile for slips like last time, so characters will be limited to X number. You CAN use alts, just don't creating new characters and just grabbing slips. Grab what you'll test with. I'll be giving you guys more come Friday after you've helped.</p>
  
  <p>Testing 3v3 matches is important. But if you can test 2v2 and 1v1 that would be helpful too. You can use this time to also see the flow of the arena if you've never done it before. Basically, all testing is important as long as you do it during the test phase.</p>
