The UI is different upon logging into the launcher.  It's more similar to XCom 1's enemy within.  Select which one you want to play.  Validates the 30g download, it seems like it's a separate, standaloneish game rather than a true content patch, and allows both to be played independently with their own sets of mods, saves, etc.  Sadly, that's probably as much as I'll get to play today, just seeing the browser and opening.</p>

<p>Apparently there's also now a challenge mode to compete for score/etc... everyone given the same troops/seed/whatnot, and competing.  Interesting concept.</p></div></article><article id="post-3907" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 7:20:30 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Going to have to wait until after work to give it a shot.  =(</p></div></article><article id="post-4001" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 10:05:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Ok... this is awesome... It's been a long time since I've done tutorial stuff in XCom 2, but it looks like a complete overhaul of the game thus far.  Leave it to Praxis to do an amazing job overhauling a complete game on just a 'DLC'</p>

<p>Btw... the XCom board game is fucking awesome as well... we just picked up the expansion to that this week, and should be playing it soon... It requires a laptop/tablet to play to handle the randomness... it's super fast and fun.</p></div></article><article id="post-4003" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 10:16:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>So far I am really enjoying it.  The Lost so far are just annoying but I know they are going to be a pain once the aliens get sprinkled in with them.

<p>I enjoyed the  board game as well.

It's super ridiculously awesome intense... Really one of my favorites... it forces turns to be taken ridiculously quickly, evaluated on how quickly you do it, and everyone is trying to manage multiple aspects of a complex command system simultaneously... Honestly, if you're a fan of XCom, you should absolutely pick up the board game... but requires 4 people to play.  So... have at least three friends?</p></div></article><article id="post-4039" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 8:49:22 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin Never heard of it before now.

<p>You can play with fewer if you need to.
