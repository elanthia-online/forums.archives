<p>I entered the arena and almost immediately a rare grahnk maneuver gave me an 8 round stun.</p>

<p>A burly grahnk charges into you!
   ... 20 points of damage!
   Good blow to your head leaves you confused!
   You are stunned for 8 rounds!</p>

<p>Rank 3 head wound and rank 2 hand.</p>

<p>I stanced down as my DS dropped well within range to critters. I made it to the last champion before running out of time.</p>

<p>Twice the Adamantine Armor kicked in :)</p>

<p>The kiramon seeker hits you, but her attack bounces harmlessly off of the incredibly hard surface of your scale armor!</p>

<p>The orc champion hits you, but her crowbill shatters into a thousand pieces against the incredibly hard surface of your scale armor!</p>

A thickset orc champion swings a closed fist at you!
You dodge just in the nick of time!

You swing a dark sigil-etched blade at a thickset orc champion!
  AS: +571 vs DS: +249 with AvD: +21 + d100 roll: +47 = +390

   Upward slash gouges the orc champion's cheek!
   Left eye lost!
   Pity.</p>

You grin.

<p>Points of note:</p>

<p>+7 off the shelf.</p>

<p>If you want to ensorcell: T1 non fixskilled sorcs was possible as of last DR, but a fixskilled sorc is needed to get to T2, and got mine to T5.</p>

<p>After T5 4x enchant was possible by a 101 spell rank wiz, but went out of range after. Test server suggests potential for 7x with fixskilled wiz.</p>

<p>Tru is enchanting his adamantine scale bp to 5x without ensorcelling, not sure if 6x is manageable without fixskilling the wiz. If you enchant first you will not reach T5. I believe even 1 enchant will make T5 a miracle cast for the best sorc in game, at +7 it was nearly impossible cast.</p>

<p>You can pad admantine. Mine is HCP.</p></div></article><article id="post-3154" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">horibu</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 9:51:03 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>That's some sweet results on the bounce off and the weapon shatter.</p></div></article><article id="post-3162" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ashraam VanEyre</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 10:27:30 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Definitely sounds like ensorcell is the better route if it's impossible to ensorcell higher enchanted adamatine armor.

<p>Depends if you care about 10td. As a rogue I definitely do, as a pure Tru apparently did not.
It's very difficult armor to do anything with, so if you do care, ensorcell first is the correct answer :)</p></div></article><article id="post-3167" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 11:56:59 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>DS is the best medicine.

<p>@Mogonis need? I think it's fun :)</p>

<p>I didn't get it to be primary defense, in fact as a capped rogue headed toward 3x dodge I rarely get hit.</p>

<p>Situations do arise! Manuvers that affect your DS as in the example, or invasions where you're I'm going to get hit and I'm going to have a chance to block, disarm, or shatter the weapon. That's something no other material can provide.</p></div></article><article id="post-3177" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Gizmo</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 12:47:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@god said in <a href="/post/3170">Adamantine Awesomeness!</a>:</p>

<p>They do, which I highly suggest getting on a Shield using Paladin or Warrior, instead of Adamantine Armor.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't think adamantine armor is all that great, compared to other armor options out there like zelnorn, or kroderine for a Voln warrior.</p>

<p>My biggest hurdle is finding good robe armor for a rogue, as most of the better armor sorts like Zelnorn etc, require armor to have metal in it.

<p>Slippery mind is good, but I use predator's eye since I hurl daggers. And since my rogue uses stealth, I find other armor properties somewhat useless...Heck, it took a bit for me to finally end up buying forest armor at DR since the price was good.</p>

<p>If I ever move out of robes, I'll likely use zelnorn armor</p></div></article><article id="post-3209" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 4:12:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Gizmo High AS is a great goal!, but you'll never know the awesomeness of Adamantine =P</p></div></article><article id="post-3211" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 4:15:50 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Adamantine makes me think of Wolverine, and that breaks my immersion.

<p>At +7 base it's workable, but gets fixed on a path as soon as you start so to speak (as I mentioned above). Ensorcell first if you plan to do it, take it to T5 before you enchant,  and you'll need the best in the Lands, beast mode, Nubunga! Other sorcs could do it if they maintained max sorc ranks too, but typically do not.</p></div></article><article id="post-3460" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Pioneer</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 26th, 2017, 8:23:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This weapon destruction ability sounds really cool.
