<p>I was chatting with @Ondreian about the loss of another feature and when he looked into it he said some other things had poofed, but he had to go out.  But yeah, that's gone, too.  So is the quick reply, but I didn't like that anyway as none of the formatting help appeared in it.</p></div></article><article id="post-1439" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 11:02:18 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What happened to the site between yesterday and today?

Skins are attributes of Themes.  Themes interpret the backend BBS to determine how to display the information.  Skins are then applied as coloring schemas to the themes's formatting.</p>

<p>This theme is more in line with the instant and intense QQing.  Most of the admins actually agreed with @Sacru and liked the original minimalist stuffs, but of course, gotta go where the majority want us to go.  But since we changed the themes, it swaps all the skins as well.  I think... probably.</p>

<p>I'm surprised a bit at the tags feature.  I guess that's governed by the theme and not the skin?  I'm not nearly as technical as the other admins, I just know how to navigate admin consoles and stuff, not mess with the html coding of blahblahblahs.  The intent for this latest reboot was to change the theme so that way we have a closer basis for when we fork and start customizing our themes based on readily available themes from teh internets.  </p>

<p>But yes... we're working on it.    It'll probably be a little while before we get it perfecter.  But honestly, continuing to post like this with feedback is more helpful than harmful, as it can ensure that while people are under the hood messing with the everything, that it's at the front of the mind.</p>

<p>Or I could pretend that we're like other forums and either not reply or say RSN if you'd prefer.</p></div></article><article id="post-1591" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 2:43:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I only understood half of that, but I appreciate the communication.</p></div></article><article id="post-1623" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 4:35:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin Appreciate the public update on this. More detail than I expected, and glad this hasn't gone to the ether. </p>

<p>What I like about the approach being taken here, and what I missed initially, is what you've essentially done is stripped it down to the barebones. With what I can only assume is with the intent to build organically from here based on user feedback. </p>

<p>I've been designing and developing websites &amp; web applications for about 15 years professionally, but never really ventured outside of php/css/html... little Ruby, Python... not a lot else. My skills couldn't touch those of an @ondreian  or @Estild, for example. These guys are in a different stratosphere from a quack such as myself, which I can also appreciate.</p>

<p>What I'm not completely understanding is the themes/skins issue. I get the separation between the two, but based on your response I'm wondering, <em>*is it possible for us to have fewer themes -- easier for the admins to maintain -- and more skins</em>?* </p>

<p>If suggestions are being considered as far as the forward movement / branching of the UI/UX options available to us, (and I will say that I was madly in love with the original theme/skin as well, not that it's any secret at this point):</p>

<ul>
<li>Placement of the upvote caret. Seemed more logical in the top-right area. Stack places it in the top-left / most prominent. Something to that, I think. Also -- when on mobile, it's a lot more difficult to hit the caret now that it's squished between the reply/quote and the sideways hamburger button.</li>
<li>Font. I'm fine with a serif font. I guess. Would be nice if we would have serif/sans-serif skin options, but beggars can't be choosers. If we're going with one or the other, though, I'd suggest that we apply those font families consistently across headings / body / subscript. If not the same family, at least something more visually similar?</li>
<li>Quick-reply was nice. So was search. Neither are totally necessary, but if the real intent was to free up some real estate in the header, why not just get rid of the giant pagination/up/down nav block that's currently taking up about 33% of the total horizontal space?</li>
<li>Symmetry/alignment. Now this IS a ridiculous request. But, the logo in the header is top-aligned. </li>
<li>Rainbow-colored icon backgrounds on the home screen. Why? Does each color signify something specific? Many people said the previous color scheme was "boring", but I say... is there any specific reason to throw so many random colors out there? The rainbow colors are making my eyes bleed (half kidding). From a functional perspective, perhaps a different color for each grouping, matching that of the heading bubble? I'm super OCD, so color schemas and right perfectly symmetrical right-angles are pretty important to me.</li>
<li>Color scheme in general. I would request fewer colors. Two, maybe three... max. Far as schemes go, why not Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Midnight? Pick a couple colors to start with and let http://paletton.com run the numbers on bi or tri-chromatic color considerations?</li>
<li>Giant header pagination module. Forces the primary menu items onto their own line. Takes up a LOT of real estate. Also, is anyone actually using this? Mouse wheel does the job for me. Personal preference...?</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
.categories&gt;li .content h2, .category&gt;ul&gt;li .content h2 {
    margin-top: 14px;
}
.content h2.title span.category-children a {
    padding: 6px 0;
    margin-top: 3px;
}
.content h2.title span.category-children a:last-child {
    margin-bottom: 9px;
}
inspector-stylesheet:16
.content h2.title span.category-children a:first-child {
    margin-top: 16px;
}
.header img.forum-logo {
    margin: 23px 0;
}
h1.navbar-brand.forum-title {
    line-height: 32px;
    height: 32px;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 23px 23px 23px 12px!important;
    color: #666;
}
ul#main-nav {
    margin: 7px 0;
}
@media (max-width: 767px) {
.header .forum-logo {
    margin-left: 15px!important;
}
}
</code></p>

<p>The above CSS block would fix a lot of visual/alignment issues that I personally have with the new layout -- those in the header and on the homepage at least, and only tested on the default theme. Semi-tested on mobile and clearly (!importantly) a bit hacked.</p>

<p>Themes are 1 per site, can't swap it without a reboot.  Most adjustments we're making are at the theme level, the coloring schemas are on the skins.  Focusing on the template first, then the skins later down the road.  All skins are pre-consolidated and delivered as part of the templates we activate.</p>

<p>It's a matter of rather having a recent posts view, than worry about the color of blue on a the dabudedabeda skin for a particular button.</p></div></article><article id="post-1630" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 4:44:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin Sounds like a plan.

<p>I'd love for some easy QOL things to eventually get on the radar, it would be trivial for instance to write a Lich script that crawls your playershop and spits out the markdown for you to update your shop post with.  It would be considerably better however, to use the NodeBB api to do it, so it's all automated for you.</p>
