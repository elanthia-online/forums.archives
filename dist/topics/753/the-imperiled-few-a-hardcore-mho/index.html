Using this form as a template, I’ll try to explain the overall theme of The Imperiled Few and what prospective members can do to help.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Purpose or Goals:</strong> The Imperiled Few seeks to find those among us who understand that for whatever reason, they are destined to face death but a single time in the course of their existence. The Few will provide a place of fellowship, camaraderie, and remembrance for those fated to soon meet their end, yet wish to live their lives to the fullest.</p>

<p>In less flowery language, the MHO will primarily serve as an IC method of indicating your status as a HARDCORE character. Beyond that, the group will be the IC face of the competition for the purposes of any in-game events. I do have other ideas for the organization. However, whether The Few grows to encompass more than these first few objectives is largely up to the desires of the HARDCORE community.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Membership:</strong> Members of our organization must be taking part in the HARDCORE competition, following all the rules that apply and are spelled out on the wiki. </p>

<p>Anyone taking part in the HC competition is welcome to join the MHO. At most, I may make a requirement that you reach level 5 first just to cut down on travel and early departures. Should (when) your character dies and you for some reason wish to continue playing that same character they will be removed from the group. Finally, I want to stress that membership in the MHO is in no way required for HARDCORE. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Primary town:</strong> Wehnimer’s Landing</p>

<p>As the majority of the HARDCORE community is in the Landing, we will be based there. I realize there are several members in the Elven Nations, and I will do my best to ensure the MHO is represented on both sides of the Dragonspine.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Event Outline:</strong> The first event the group will run will be a “mixer” of sorts, where fellow HARDCORE members can meet and socialize with each other in an otherwise isolated gameplay experience. </p>

<p>I have plans for our first official event to be something useful to HARDCORE competitors, but I haven’t been able to get ahold of the right people. Assuming said plans fall through, the first event would still remain a meet and greet, with inductions for those who wish to become members. Other ideas for events are in the works, but I’d like to avoid spelling them out in detail until I can line up support and have concrete plans in place.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Leadership:</strong> ?</p>

<p>I haven’t given too much thought to officer positions due to the transient nature of the organization’s participants. I also realize for the vast majority of you, your HARDCORE character is a secondary diversion and not your main focus. I planned on doing most of the heavy lifting, so that members can just come and enjoy themselves if the events offered interested them, but if people want to get involved the more the merrier. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Group Crest:</strong> How about yet ANOTHER contest??</p>

<p>I believe symbolism is important tool for roleplay and self-identification. That being said, I’d rather let the community decide how they’d like to represent themselves. The next competition will be to design the look of our crest and general motif moving forward. Details will be provided in a separate post.</p>

<h2>TL:DR – A HARDCORE MHO called The Imperiled Few is in the works and will be up and running as soon as I can fit the pieces together. I’ll post updates to this thread as they appear.

<p>Glad to hear it, man. With the new F2P section, there's now some goals to chase on that front as well.</p></div></article><article id="post-8323" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, January 23rd, 2018, 7:31:39 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p><img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/679/897/32d.gif" alt="alt text" title="" /></p>

<p>The Imperiled Few is now an official MHO!</p>

<p>I'm still hoping to get in contact with two groups regarding events, but I may try to organize something smaller in the next week or two. Here is the place to give your opinions or requests of the MHO and I will do my best to accommodate.</p></div></article><article id="post-8324" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, January 23rd, 2018, 8:43:57 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Evarin </p>
