<p>The response was fairly clear they felt it was not balanced today, and was told we wouldn't want to see a review. Meaning they'd nurf it. </p>

<p>What I've specifically gathered from this through speaking with players is that wracking is OP and would be nurfed and players would be very unhappy.</p>

<p>As a gamer I'm more interested in game balance, and so for the record, I am calling for a COL review.</p>

<p>Breath some life into it rather than nurf it. If there is a mechanic that is so unbalancing they don't want to move forward then there is a problem that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>So many signs in COL are utterly useless, this society needs a revamp.</p></div></article><article id="post-2586" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 1:07:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>They'd also want to nerf the duration of the signs.

<p>While yes, scripts make them not big deals, the lower the duration, the higher the likelihood of going without them due to RT, and reduced overall uptime.</p>

<p>I would almost prefer if something like GOS was a series of martial stances where max mana/stamina was reduced rather than reapplying the sigils, just because it's one less thing to worry about/manage/etc.</p></div></article><article id="post-2595" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 1:31:26 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'd rather them separate the mechanical review of CoL and simply do a roleplay-based one to reinvent/modernize the society. </p>

<p>Id much rather have it where having the sigil or sign up RESERVES a portion of your mana/stamina, meaning it lowers its max, and you dont have to keep updating it. Cause theres no reason for that shit. It doesnt add to 'fun' or 'strategy' for your basic sigils/symbols to constantly be needing to be reapplied. It just makes things tedious.</p></div></article><article id="post-2600" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 1:44:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@crime said in <a href="/post/2593">COL review - GM response at Simucon needs rethink.</a>:</p>

<p>There are problems unique to CoL when it comes to that, though. People can't talk about it publicly, which cuts out lots of RP potential.

<p>This. One thing I can get onboard with is that there should be an additional reason for a "good" character to feel ill-at-ease in CoL aside from a few throwaway lines from the Pooh-bear.

<p>I am...very, very aware of many peoples inability to separate IC from OOC. I have had some issues with that in the past that I shant get into here! Suffice it to say it put the fear of god into me, where I learned that there are people on here that if you do anything to their character in game...if they could? They would find you and literally kill you in real life.</p>

<p>THAT, however, should never scare us or keep us away from being true to our characters and Roleplaying interesting stories.</p>

<p>As to the conflict potential...part of the fun is that true to their nature (as I see it), CoL members would be involved in helping the 'good guys'. They are very much more Behind the Scenes players than 'OOH SPOOKY IN YOUR FACE EVIL'. The powers behind the throne, as it were, manipulating the heroes for unknown and perhaps nefarious purposes.</p></div></article><article id="post-2805" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 12:57:29 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This is a mechanics forum, not a role play, so the comments relating to IC vs OOC are perhaps a touch off topic. Welcome none the less for the flavor of the game.</p>

<p>As for ideas regarding what do to with COL, frankly I'd leave that up to the GM realm. I can point out the obvious issues today:</p>

<p>Pretty simple, there are many signs that are not used:</p>

<p>Sign of hypnosis, possession, lower level staunch (was very appropriate when spending $6/hr, not so much with Dreaven script to get you to level 20 in the blink of an eye), (regretfully) ESP,  hopelessness, and even madness due to the spirit drain and boss mobs not being critable in invasions. Sure one can use their imagination for when one might use some of these, but that's not the overall intent of society skills in Gemstone today.

<p>I kind of feel the difference between the mana regaining abilities is supposed to be a reflection of the societies themselves.  CoL is high cost, high reward - you use wracking, yeah you get all your mana back, but you suffer a LOT of penalties with reduced spirit.  If you introduce a more moderate ability, it really removes some of the character and risk/reward from CoL.</p></div></article><article id="post-3104" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017, 8:36:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm thinking pures mostly care about wracking, everything else is ancillary.

<p>I don't think we can expect better communication, in fact I might discourage it, I think a gaming company needs independence on something of this scale.

<p>I disagree with this statement. Above all, there should be a focus on roleplay for any major mechanics feature, especially as large as a society.

Yeah, staunching is basically 1 mana to never bleeding again ever, but if the entire society were more engaging, I doubt anyone anywhere would complain about a tweak to make it work a little less effectively. I doubt too many people would complain if wracking were tweaked either, so long as the society became more engaging. Wracking already has plenty of drawbacks.

<p>1    Sign of Recognition Allows the character to identify other members and their relative ranks. - <strong>Seems fine to me.</strong></p>

<p>2    Signal  Use sign language to communicate with other society members in the room. - <strong>Would be nice to see RP verbs added for CoL only members.</strong></p>

<p>3    Sign of Warding +5 to DS.   1   0   Invoked 10 sec/level - <strong>Short of a base duration change, I think this is fine.</strong></p>

<p>4    Sign of Striking    +5 to AS.   1   0   Invoked 10 sec/level - <strong>Short of a base duration change, I think this is fine.</strong></p>

<p>5    Sign of Clotting    Stops all bleeding. 1   0   Invoked 10 sec/level - <strong>Redundant with Staunching. Should be removed or replaced entirely.</strong></p>

<p>6    Sign of Thought Gives the same effect as rubbing a crystal amulet.  1   0   Invoked -  <strong>Seems fine.</strong></p>

<p>7    Sign of Defending   +10 to DS.  2   0   Invoked 10 sec/level - <strong>Short of a base duration change, seems fine.</strong></p>

<p>8    Sign of Smiting +10 to AS.  2   0   Invoked 10 sec/level - <strong>Short of a base duration change, seems fine.</strong></p>

<p>9    Sign of Staunching  Stops all bleeding. 1   0   Invoked 20 sec/level - <strong>Combine with clotting, otherwise very useful.</strong></p>

<p>10    Sign of Deflection  Adds +20 to Bolt DS.    3   0   Invoked 10 sec/level - <strong>Short of a base duration change, seems fine.</strong></p>

<p>11    Sign of Hypnosis    Calms a random target with a hidden warding check.  0   1   Invoked Variable - <strong>Would change to a system where you can charm certain creatures for a set amount of time. Would no longer be hostile unless attacked, instead attack others. Cost could vary by target type/level.</strong> </p>

<p>12    Sign of Swords  Adds +20 to AS. 0   1   Dissipates  10 sec/level - <strong>Possible base duration change, otherwise fine.</strong></p>

<p>13    Sign of Shields Adds +20 to DS. 0   1   Dissipates  10 sec/level - <strong>Possible base duration change, otherwise fine.</strong></p>

<p>14    Sign of Dissipation Adds +15 to TD. 0   1   Dissipates  10 sec/level - <strong>Possible base duration change, otherwise fine.</strong></p>

<p>15    Sign of Healing Fully regenerates all hit points.   0   2   Invoked - <strong>Seems fine.</strong></p>

<p>16    Sign of Madness Adds +50 to AS and subtracts -50 from DS.   0   3   Dissipates  15 seconds - <strong>I'd stretch out the bonus and penalty phase and lower/eliminate the spirit cost. Add a cooldown timer with escalating costs.</strong> </p>

<p>17    Sign of Possession  Mass calms the room with a hidden warding check.    0   4   Invoked Variable - <strong>Same as Hypnosis. Could either be combined and allow for open/focused cast, or remain room wide with same purpose.</strong></p>

<p>18    Sign of Wracking    Fully regenerates all mana. 0   5   Invoked - <strong>I'd up the cost to 6, but otherwise balancing this sign is tricky without significant revisions elsewhere. 6 points would mean investment in Aura enhancives in order to to use multiple times in a row, which is fine.</strong></p>

<p>19    Sign of Darkness    Teleports the user to a "safe point" or to the nearest Council chapter (whichever is closer).   0   6   Invoked - <strong>Lower cost and add the ability to use the sign when under duress in exchange for a -3 penalty to spirit recovery for a set amount of time.</strong></p>

<p>20    Sign of Hopelessness    Causes you to decay while dead. - <strong>I liked the ability to kill yourself on command. Not sure why they nerfed that.</strong></p>

<p>General notes: I'd like to see base durations of CoL signs raised a bit, and a small reduction on the high end. 2 minutes off the top and added to the base would be a good start. </p>

<p>They could add a ton more signs, so it'd really depend on where they wanted to take the direction of the society to come up with ideas. I think messing with Spirit recovery for CoL signs as a cost is a good idea. This could be offset by doing upkeep tasks for the Council, or just paying an increasing bribe in order to bypass the busy work as a possible silver sink. </p>

<p>In general, I like the idea of being able to manipulate creatures to fight along side you, if briefly. It fits with the corrupting nature of the society. It'd be neat to see innate bonuses against certain creature types along with innate weaknesses. These modifiers could be modified both in the characters favor or to his detriment depending on how involved they are with the Council, providing a means of upkeep costs and potential RP hooks down the line.</p></div></article><article id="post-3165" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 11:49:54 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/3146">COL review - GM response at Simucon needs rethink.</a>:</p>

<p>Ideally, all things would be equally viable...or equally desirable. From a balance/design perspective, that is very very hard to do. But it is the holy grail...to have different people want different things for the RP/COOL factor and yet still have them be able to be powerful! (maybe in different circumstances, and in different ways....but no one should feel like they CANT choose to use a certain weapon base or be in a society because it will severely limit their ability to mechanically progress)</p>

<p>I'd argue that when it comes to a society, it needs to not just be mechanically viable (which CoL IS at present) but also Mechanically Attractive (which, it is the OP's contention, CoL is NOT at present)</p>

<p>It is a mechanics board, yes, but this is Gemstone. RP is and should be a factor in all discussions...right now my biggest problem with CoL is that from an RP perspective it is the most Interesting Potentially, but there is absolutely 0 use of its potential. This fault both lies with the players AND Simutronics.</p>

<p>So. In my mind, two things should be done.
1. Revamp and reignite the RP of CoL amongst the playerbase with storylines and other methods. Give players more tools to conduct interesting storylines themselves.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go through each sign that is never/almost never used and fix it so people will at least sometimes use them. Give us Meaningful Choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is what we want: Meaningful Choice INTERNALLY.

<p>Possession /Hypnoses / Madness - I think dependency on spirit is an issue overall if the drain is immediate or even delayed.

<p>I know your post was 14 days ago, but I think it deserves a direct response.  Crime never said Col in it's entirety is not mechanically useful.  He said "So many signs in COL are utterly useless, this society needs a revamp" and in the post immediately before yours he specifically mentioned 6 signs.  That's 6 signs out of a total of 20.  While I appreciate your sentiment toward the society, I think dismissing Crime's point of view and telling him if he doesn't like it to just go join another society is rude.  You also misrepresented his views in your post.  Feel what you want to feel about someone else's opinion, but I would suggest making sure you don't put words in to other people's mouths so to speak.  Making the blanket inaccurate statements that he does not find COL mechanically useful and that "most of the rest of the playerbase is not intereted in seeing" such a revamp is making a lot of assumptions and does not lend itself to constructive conversations.</p></div></article><article id="post-4292" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 9:21:56 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@viekn Estild said directly that we wouldn't like a revamp of CoL.

<p>I didn't assume tone.  I just think it's rude to convey a meaning or an idea from someone else's words when they didn't specifically state that.  You could argue that Kragdruk got the "the rest of the playerbase is not interested in seeing" idea from Estild, but that's still an assumption on Krag's part and also on Estild's part which probably shouldn't have been a blanket statement on his part either.  But also stating that Crime thought COL was not mechanically useful was an inaccurate representation based on what Crime had written.  I believe doing that kind of thing is inherently rude, regardless of tone.  I'll chime in regarding wracking in next post.</p></div></article><article id="post-4302" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 10:45:18 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I never said it wasn't mechanically useful.

The only signs I ever use are: striking, smiting, swords, warding, defending, shields, and wracking.  There are other useful signs, but 99% of the time, that's it.  Based on Estild's and your remarks, and for the sake of conversation, let's assume wracking is the hang up here.</p>

<p>Based off of what I know only (which isn't everything), there are two types of people who use wracking: CS pures for hunting, and anyone else who has enough mana and spell knowledge to self spell and uses wracking to help them spell themselves up.  It's not useful in hunting for bolting pures because of the AS hit due to the spirit drain.
For CS pures, a nerf to wracking would have an impact on their hunt.  Let's assume there are two end goals to hunting: gaining exp till fried or generating treasure.  From my own experience, I've never needed a completely new tank of mana in order to fry.  Getting back like 25%-50% of my total mana pool would easily allow me to fry.  And that's really just on the first hunt after my mind was completely clear before.  If, like most people I assume, you are just waiting until muddled or just below to go back out, then my current mana pool is more than enough to fry.  So even for a CS hunter, it really shouldn't be much of an issue if wracking were tweaked to not automatically regenerate your entire mana pool.  Now for treasure, sure, you aren't going to be able to stay out as long and hunt if wracking were tweaked downward.  But with treasure, you get to a point of diminishing returns because of the encumbrance any way.  I would still think that even with a tweak to wracking, someone who previously used it to stay out for a long time and generate tons of treasure is still going to be fine.  Addressing the issue of spelling yourself up, yes wracking does make it easier, but I certainly don't need the ability to regenerate 100% of my mana pool to get it done.  Worst case is that it takes me a few minutes longer to get it done.  The only true area that I think would be effected most notably is sorcerers who treasure hunt and grind Duskruin.  In that circumstance, because of sorcs ability to reduce their encumbrance, they'd have to head back in sooner than before.  And with Duskruin and specifically the sorc spells that are used for that, I would imagine it would definitely reduce their effectiveness as it currently stands.  But I do not think any of those reasons are good enough not to look at updating COL.  If improving the RP of COL and maybe introducing on going tasks or reasons to be more involved on a day to day basis with the society means the signs also have to be looked at, I think it should be done and given time to acclimate, I think people would get used to some of the changes that would be hard to swallow in the short term.</p></div></article><article id="post-4304" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 11:05:08 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@crime said in <a href="/post/4302">COL review - GM response at Simucon needs rethink.</a>:</p>

<p>Crime can speak for himself, but I don't think the intent of his suggestion of a COL review is sign waste or similar benefit consolidation.  The issue seems to be more so that RP wise and in regards to daily interactions with the society, COL is more of a throwaway society.  It's easy to master and after you've mastered, no one has anything to do with it afterwards other than using the signs.  The call is for a review to either flesh it out or revamp it in order to give it a more RP centered focus and give players an avenue to do something more with it on a daily basis.  </p>

<p>The issue of signs and the waste/redundancy only came up because others pointed to the potential changes to the signs as a reason for Simu not to review COL.  Some of us then countered that changes to signs/powers alone wasn't a good enough reason for a review not to happen.  And then some others disagreed.  Signs/powers has never been the gripe, at least not in this case.</p></div></article><article id="post-4319" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 12:23:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Personally I think the main issue with CoL not having flavor is that it's been mechanically discouraged since it's inception.

<p>Currently the only way to advance CoL RP and flavor is to get members to show up to an event for it. Somehow. Through LNet probably, which is already a bad start, and as anyone who's thrown an event knows, it's like herding cats.</p>

<p>CoL has some of the most potentially cool RP around it, but it's super stifled and always has been by the fact that you can't talk about it in public. </p>

<p>I think if there were some way to make CoL more "socially acceptable" to talk about, it would allow the RP to grow around it like has been done for Sunfist and Voln.

<p>Yeah, I know what he meant. I can't speak to Sunfist RP, but Voln I've always felt was more on a character to character bases, being integrated into that character's RP rather than being a big group RP type of thing. For example, Flimbo will often go on tangents about punching ghosts to release their flavor. I've included things like that in events I've held as well as everyday conversations. That's directly Voln related, even if it doesn't drive Voln's storyline in any way shape or form. I'm sure you could integrate talking about the Grimswarm into the RP of your Sunfist character in a similar way. With CoL, you just can't do that. No opportunity unless you wanna get ganked by an assassin. That's the part I hate about it. It's very difficult to have it add anything to your character flavor-wise.</p></div></article><article id="post-4329" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kragdruk</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 12:52:02 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@viekn Don't misquote me.

<p>Then you have GOS, which is subjectively worse.  Their primary sigils last slightly longer than Voln, but their major sigils are only 90 seconds with hefty mana/stamina up-keep.</p>

<p>So, if you want to know what Simu is going to nerf with a COL re-vamp, it's going to be duration and cost.  Instead of spending 1 spirit for Swords and 1 spirit for Shields every 16 minutes, you'll spend them every 4-5 minutes.  For anyone not a halfling or whatever - that means you'll have a hard time keeping up with the spirit drain during a hunt.</p>

<p>Wracking probably wouldn't change much at all.  They need to move some of the signs away from spirit because spirit is too precious to expend for a mass calm or hypnosis.  Spirit doesn't just impact your AS, but also substantially reduces your DS.</p></div></article><article id="post-4343" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">viekn</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 1:33:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@kragdruk said in <a href="/post/4329">COL review - GM response at Simucon needs rethink.</a>:</p>

  <p>@viekn Don't misquote me. I said "a society revamp that most of the rest of the playerbase is not interested in seeing". <strong>Most</strong> of the the player base. A majority. If you are paying attention, the reaction at Simucon and in this thread seems to back that up.</p>
  
  <p>Not really sure how you can argue that switching a character to another society is less work than advocating for a significant amount of GM work. GM time is by far the most limited resource we have. CoL is very viable as-is for many people, so I would much rather see the GM effort put into a new society instead of revamping an existing one that works well for many people. I would have no problem with them working on the RP aspects of CoL, but Crime specifically mentioned the mechanical aspects ie signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're right, when I quoted you, I left off the "most of", which does qualify your statement a bit.  I went back and edited my quote to more accurately reflect yours.  That was unintentional and thank you for pointing it out.  I still don't think its accurate or useful to assume it's most of the player base's reaction though.  You used this forum and Simcon as evidcence, but how many people went to simucon and out of the 262 users on this forum, it seems like only 50 or so are the most active posters, and far less than that have chimed in against a COL review.</p>

<p>I'm not arguing that switching a character to another society is less work than advocating for significant GM work on COL.  But is that not the definition of taking the easy way out?</p>

<p>I think the issue is this: Out of the 3 societies that exist, which is the most outdated, whose RP purpose and origins have no real connection to the GSIV game world of today?   For those reasons alone, and for all the other areas of the game Simu is working to improve, why wouldn't that qualify for a review as well?</p></div></article><article id="post-4344" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 1:38:16 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I disagree, Ashraam.

Currently that's how a few of the signs function currently - Wracking specifically. In a lot of cases with wracking you destroy your own ability to continue the hunt if you use it. Anyone who uses AS to hunt, or needs DS to survive takes a significant hit from using it, and only a few races can quickly close the gap and make that hit less lasting. I'd much prefer to have wracking useful for everyone that can use mana in much the way symbol of mana is if it meant it opened it to a wider array of characters to use.</p>

<p>In this hypothetical revamp, I would think if anything, maybe they'd take spirit out of the equation altogether, or alter how it functions on a base level, just as a thought.

  <p>Yes, but increasing meaningful choice while keeping the high value objects the same doesn't really reconcile either, it'd end up being a pure buff.

<p>As a DE sorcerer with 300+ mana and 11 spirit, I use wracking.  I can do a lot more with wracking than I can with Power or Mana from other societies.  I also have two +spirit regen items I can hold for on-node regeneration.</p>

<p>However, it takes a lot of resources to make it powerful.  I could accomplish the same thing with Symbol of Power and lots of deeds.  Or, I could get max stamina and stamina regeneration enhancives to better use Power... but still that one doesn't really compete.</p>

<p>Wracking isn't likely the main reason that COL has any power edge.  The sign up-keep is 3-4x more effective than any other society.  Losing spirit at a rate of 2-3 every 4-5 minutes vs 2-3 every 16 minutes is a much bigger deal.</p>

<p>Just remember - there are three signs that many capped players using COL would like to keep active - Sign of Swords, Sign of Shields and Sign of Dissipation.  That's +15 to AS/DS/TD.  This costs you 3 spirit every 16 minutes currently.  If that was comparable duration to Voln or GOS, it would cost you 3 spirit every 4-5 minutes.  That's a lot of spirit loss and very little time to regenerate.  Most races will only be able to regen 1-2 of that spirit loss before the next time those signs wear off, assuming you refresh them immediately.  Your hunt is going to be significantly shortened.</p>

<p>There is a lot more power tied to the duration of the signs than people realize.</p></div></article><article id="post-4367" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 2:38:50 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I wait 2-3 mintues after using Swords and Shields to use Dissipation.

</blockquote>

<p>Of course, it's a valid strategy to be sure - but consider what happens if those current durations are messed with.</p>

<p>Lets say they decided that the duration for COL is too powerful.  They tinker and make it 15 seconds to RANK.  That means you get 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Lets say you're a Giantman (because it's middle of the road spirit regen)</p>

<p>You start up Sign of Swords / Shields at the start of your hunt, and then 2 minutes into the hunt you start Sign of Dissipation.  At 5 minutes, Swords/Shields fall taking you from 10 spirit to 8 spirit.</p>

<p>Off-Node a Giant regenerates 1 spirit every 3 minutes.  In 2 minutes, your sign of Dissipation now falls off, and you're stuck at 7 spirit for the next 60 seconds.  Ok, 60 seconds go by, back up to 8 spirit.  Great!  Full AS/DS.</p>

<p>Oh wait, you have 3 minutes left on your refreshed Sign of Swords/Shields.  Ok, 3 minutes pass, and you're back up to 9 spirit but Swords/Shields fall off -- down to 7 spirit.  2 minutes later Dissipation falls off - back down to 6 spirit now... Ugh.</p>

<p>You see how this treadmill never gets better?  Those durations are crucial to COL, and that's where the major power differential is between COL and the other two societies.  People underestimate the power of having 16 minute duration on Signs at cap.</p>

<p>You look at Elves and DE, and they're in a world of pain without significant investment into enhancives to mitigate the spirit drain if those durations were ever changed.</p></div></article><article id="post-4369" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 3:25:30 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@leafiara said in <a href="/post/4351">COL review - GM response at Simucon needs rethink.</a>:</p>

<p>Hmmmmmmm...what I'm hearing is that we should rename spirit to "midichlorians" and make it Monk only and also Monks get a bonus for having a lot of it because I have 12 and it just sits there taunting me.

<p>You proposed a good idea, Leafiara! Spirit should be changed to Monk force powers! This is a Monk thread now! To the Monk folder with it!</p>

<p>It only goes to prove that all things, when you wish hard enough, are about Monks.</p>

I applaud game designers, but not to a fault, so let them come up with ideas and then let them QC them. That's their job. All I care about is good game design.</p>
  
  <p>Go scream all you want, but you're shouting into the wind if you are against evolution. CoL needs a rethink by the designers.</p>

<p>The people drive the storylines. Kenstrom has said many times that he writes the basic concept but it's the player's actions and involvement the mold it. =) </p>

<p>The Landing has seen a decisive shift from black/white to grey over the past 5ish years, with a definite skewing towards the darker greys. And this is from a player standpoint. It has definitely led to some interesting developments and RP, and has been totally interesting to watch from the outside.</p>

<p>I had hoped that when Grishom Stone rebuilt the Landing COL that we'd see some kind of refresh of the RP for the society, but we did not. CoL has always been OP, and even after the Voln review and updates I think that still holds true. Sometimes, when we ask for change, we don't get what we want. I'd rather see the GMs continue to develop new things and revise those that are in larger need of change then to take the chance on seeing a full-on mechanical CoL review that could very well turn into Wizardggedon 2.0.</p></div></article><article id="post-4533" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 7th, 2017, 11:54:19 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Sabotage the evidence of your ignorance is your unwillingness to acknowledge the community.</p>

<p>1, 2, 3, 4... I added numbers, I disagree with madness being worthless.  There are 20 signs in COL.  That's 4/20.  That is 20%.  Where does the 30% come into play?  What have changed in the last 2 hours when you referenced worthless signs?  16 days ago, you also referenced sign of thought, which each society has, so that's at an additional worthless ability across the board, plus, it's not important enough for you to note here, and there have been people that say it's incredibly useful and that it's not worthless.</p>

<p>Per my previous post, there are also 3 sigils (15%), and 5 Symbols (19.23%) that are also worthless.

<p>"It has not been touched" is not an argument, it's an assertion which ignores the myriad of other mechanics and established systems that have not been sufficiently reviewed since inception.  80% effectiveness of a mechanic?  Should we take a look at the various forms of weapon types?  Why are you not calling for a review of whip blades to make them effective versus a handaxe?  Why are you not calling for halberds to be buffed because they're basically nagintas with 20 less AvD?

  <p>Even the GM's want to avoid this conundrum because they fear the backlash LO, and that is the bigger truth.</p>

<p>I find it highly amusing that you tacked on a completely unnecessary comment about how people opposing your view have debated "nastily" at times. While reading through this entire thread, I've seen you call people names, call their intelligence into question and be an overall prickly and argumentative person. Almost exclusively throwing out the insult gauntlet first.</p>

<p>There is merit on both sides of this argument, and perhaps instead of lashing out and completely ignoring the other side of the argument, you could try and understand it and why some people don't agree with you. My suggestion, in the future, is that if you just wish to speak directly to Simutronics, use Feedback where the only answer you will receive will be from staff. A forum is a place for debate, discussion and back and forth, don't expect to post something there that opposes the opinions of other people without receiving some argument back and forth. Calling anyone who disagrees with you a troll in a weak attempt to negate their point of view, despite the numerous sound and valid arguments made in this thread, seems to be the roadblock here to any real discussion on the point.</p>

<p>Now it's clear to me that your only reasoning for wanting a CoL review is because of the parts of it that don't work for your character(s) and not something that the population, as a whole has agrees with. If that's the case, you're welcome to your opinion, but Simu is never going to revamp and entire society based on the unhappy minority.</p></div></article><article id="post-4691" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 10:37:12 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Riend actually the only obsolete parts I'm talking about are parts that are obsolete for everyone.

<p>Really, have you actually ran a poll to get everyone's opinion on the matter? Because so far, everyone in this thread has disagreed with you.</p></div></article><article id="post-4696" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 10:45:09 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>That's just not true, read from thr start, but you do seem sour on the idea.

<p>The GM statement saying we'd never like a review in itself is too damaging to a constructive outcome. People would vote against out of knee jerk reaction.</p>

<p>I see nothing wrong with fixing signs that no profession ever uses though, and the sour reaction is caused in no small part by GM comments.</p>

<p>Telling us they'll make us all unhappy if they reviewed it is a sad thing.</p></div></article><article id="post-4699" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 11:10:04 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@crime <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif" alt="alt text" title="" /></p></div></article><article id="post-4702" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 8th, 2017, 11:37:20 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@crime said in <a href="/post/4696">COL review - GM response at Simucon needs rethink.</a>:</p>

<p>Everyone who has mentioned they would like to see a review, has called for an RP review. Not a review of the mechanics. Of course that would require you to actually look at this objectively, something you seem unwilling to do.  I went back and looked at it. While a handful of people came up with some idea that could be useful, no one aside from yourself has outright called for the review of the <strong>mechanical aspects of CoL.</strong> </p>

<p>As for being sour towards you? Not particularly. I'm fairly ambivalent about you, but the way you've conducted yourself in this thread most definitely leaves something to be desired.  I'm glad that the only thing you took from my posts was my attacking your motivations, that really puts into perspective the way you view any constructive criticism towards your person.</p>

<p>I have posted throughout this thread my opinions about the state of CoL, the RP around CoL and the ramifications of a review of the society, all of which were done without attacking anyone. If you consider my previous post an attack on you but you feel that the insults you've tossed out to people as "OK," then I'm pretty sure we're not going to be able to come to a general understanding of one another.</p></div></article><article id="post-4860" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 5:44:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I would definitely like to see an RP review of CoL, the whole lodge and grand poohbear and the outright dislocation of this particular society with everything else RP-wise from the game is an eyesore. </p>

<p>Whoa. That is hardcore. </p>

<p>I want those society buffs so bad, I start any new characters in a society at level 4 and start grinding immediately. I try and have CoL girls mastered by level 10, GoS by 18. Unsure how long Voln takes these days, haven't mastered on anyone since my main did such for the third time years back.</p></div></article><article id="post-4862" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 5:52:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Why level 4?
