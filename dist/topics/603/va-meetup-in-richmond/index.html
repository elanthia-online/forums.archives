<p>Right now shooting for early December.</p>

<p>Thinking more of an day trip this time so if people come from further they aren't driving 2+ hrs for just dinner.</p>

<p>Thinking a Saturday and start at like 3pm. until ???.  You know the best events are until ??? so its a guaranteed good time!  Don't forget to bring 2 bottles of wine to make sure it is (I hope he has a good sense of humor).</p>

<p>Let me know if there are specific dates people can't make.</p></div></article><article id="post-6724" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Necios</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 18th, 2017, 1:34:00 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>if we bring 2 bottles of wine do we have to ride someone like a roller coaster? and if so can we choose whom?</p></div></article><article id="post-6725" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 18th, 2017, 1:47:27 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@necios <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/307edabd19d8e80f972a873bb29ea1fb/tenor.gif" alt="alt text" title="" /></p></div></article><article id="post-6730" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 18th, 2017, 2:38:24 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Okay so I have missed the last two and I REALLY don't want to miss this one so tentatively count me in but I know I wouldn't stay for the whole thing probably a 3 to after dinner thing provided no family events because it's close to XMAS.</p>
