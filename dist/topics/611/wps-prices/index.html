This was my quote from Duskruin:</p>

<pre><code> Item: a silvery blue mithril pike
 Modified Weighting Type: Critical
 Current Service Window Count: 0
 Service Window Reset: 0d 0h 0m
 Estimated Costs:
   Next Service: 738 bloodscrip
   Next 5 Services: 3694 bloodscrip
   Next 10 Services: 8311 bloodscrip
   Next 15 Services: 19394 bloodscrip
   Next 20 Services: 32323 bloodscrip
   Next 25 Services: 72959 bloodscrip
</code></pre>

<p>At the time, I got 10 services done.  I am still in that 60-day window.</p>

<p><strong>My quote from Saryen for 10 more services (crit weighting) was 14434060.  So that's a conversion rate of 601 silver per scrip.  Kind of like "half price" relative to current BS/silver exchange rate.</strong></p>
