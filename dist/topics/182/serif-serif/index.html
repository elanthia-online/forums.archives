<p>I refuse to accept a serif font, unless in physically printed form. Refuse/Resist!!</p>

<p>Yeah, I know. I do web design and specialize in marketing/advertising because that's the only job you can get outside of teaching with a degree in Sociocultural and Linguistic Anthropology. That's why I said "For the last 20 years" in my original post. :P The only websites that still use serif fonts (with notable specific exception circumstances) are English language Asian sites because they evoke a typesetting that's closer to most Asian written languages. Even traditionally serif "professional" settings, like banks, have all switched to sans in US based websites at this point. </p>

<p>Hence, serif looks wrong and hurts my brain.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
