<p>-A Claidhmore will not be normally blessable.</p>

<p>-A Claidhmore will not be normally flareable, except in the case of very rare auction level weaponry.</p>

<p>-Weapons of Heavy, 10 points or Katana level or below , will be blessable and Flareable.</p>

<p>-Weapons above Heavy weighting will not be blessable or flareable under normal circumstances, which I take as player blessing or flaring but merchant workable depending upon the amount of weighting.</p>

<p>-Bard sonic weapons will be blessable and flareable.</p>

<p>-Cleric bless will now yield blessed status and holy water flares on crit weighted weaponry.</p>

<p>-Paladin Bonding does not add guiding light flares to crit weighted weaponry even on heavy and below.</p>

<p>I think this was the initial knee-jerk reaction for a lot of people, and I'm sure a lot of folks have questions about it, as do I. </p>

<p>If they made weighted/flaring weapons blessable with 304, it could be considered nerf to any current owner of a permablessed or undead bane weapon.</p>

<p>So, rather than nerfing/devaluing a bunch of stuff, they just made a bunch of items even better by increasing the number of potential enhancements we can add to our current gear.</p>

<p>If I'm wrong about any of this, someone please stop me at any time.

<p>You can't deny that a permabless/undead-bane weapon would still hold weight. And with the recent changes, I can actually see a strong argument for allowing a bless on a weighted/flaring weapon so long as it is not both weighted and flaring. </p>

<p>Whether blessable or no, it's not going to stop me from picking up an undead bane cert this Friday if they intend to make them available again this run, because my desire is to also add flares at some point.</p></div></article><article id="post-1665" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 9:31:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@estild Excellent!

<p>This is true, as is the "one weapon all the time".  Undead bane does have a couple other benefits but the once unique ability for a crit weighted weapon to also hit undead is a major feature and factor in the cost.</p>

<p>Considering the prices Duskruin has even recently been selling the add-on for ($thousands), I hope it gains an ability like locating undead or immolate like plasma flare pointing (subscript?)  :)  That is assuming opening up all gear HCW and down all get the ability to easily bless.  A Volner wouldn't really have a problem other than a few bless expirations mid battle, and the lack of a flare or small AS or some weighting increase.  To me though, those were never the main mechanical attraction.  I even picked plasma flare just for RP.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a decently crit weighted UB weapon gets the (remote?) possibility of adding a..flare in return.</p></div></article><article id="post-1737" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 2:12:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>"Weapons of Heavy, 10 points or Katana level or below , will be blessable and Flareable."</p>

<p>I would say that standard flaring weapons got a bump, yes, but much smaller than standard weighted weapons.  It's generally been easier, from my experience, to add flares to a weapon.</p>

<p>In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the adv. guild's flares see more uses, since you can have your weighted weapon, add flares when you want, then bless when you don't.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for explaining that you lose the holy water flare aspect and cannot have 2 flares (1 from script, 1 from bless spell) at the same time.  However, do you always only get holy water flares from a cleric on it and so have not ever tested a lesser bless or a voln bless for example?  Does it not also work?  In that is the case, then it isn't really turning a holy water flare (and so not working for regular blesses) into another flare, it is just dropping or blocking the holy water flare so that one flare works, as you have noted.</p>

<p>Yes of course you should have holy water flares if appropriately cast at your weapon, but before you activate the script as it is at that moment just a blessed wepaon like any other.</p></div></article><article id="post-1764" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 4:02:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@roblar </p>

<p>I haven't tested other sources.  I will soon and get back to you.  When it's set to holy water, the analyze is quite descriptive.  When I change it the analyze changes, to always say what it is set to. </p>

<p>Ok, I just used symbol of blessing on it, and it basically entered a state identical to when a cleric with holy water flares blesses it.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that the weapon kicks in when a bless from any source is cast at it, so it will allow you to get Holy Water flares from any source of blessing, not just Clerics, which is a nice upgrade.  However, my understanding is that they're functionally identical to the holy water flares granted by a Cleric bless.</p></div></article><article id="post-1776" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 4:32:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex Holy water flares are rather weak and don't also hit the living while these flares do, unless you mean something else?</p></div></article><article id="post-1777" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 4:34:37 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>When the weapon is first blessed, it has holy water flares, identical to those granted by a cleric.
