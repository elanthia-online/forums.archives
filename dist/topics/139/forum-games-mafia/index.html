<p>Basic premise for a standard newbie-ish game is there are two factions, town and mafia, town don't know whose who, and may consist of a few power roles added in to mostly vanilla players.  Mafia is significantly smaller, but know who each other are.  Game has a day and a night phase.  Day phase players make posts and try and figure out whose mafia, and vote to lynch them, thus killing that person.  During the night, mafia can talk via PMs, but town can not talk.  Mafia get to pick a player to try and kill overnight.  The cycle then repeats.  There are near limitless variations based on number of factions, power roles, ect, but that is the bare bones of it.</p>

<p>If this is something that would interest you to try, I'd be willing to run a fairly simple game to introduce people to it, but only if there is sufficient interest.  Post here with any thoughts, or if interested.</p></div></article><article id="post-1250" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 11th, 2017, 2:51:28 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Sounds very intriguing.

<p>Any questions or points you'd like clarified, let me know.  I'll leave this open for another couple days to see if anyone else wants to sign up, 7 is doable, but more is better when it comes to balancing the game out.</p></div></article><article id="post-2330" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Claudaro</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 19th, 2017, 1:29:39 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Alright, I'm gonna go with these numbers, and get working on a seven player game.

<p>This is almost as bare bones basic as it can get.  Some of the games I've played in or run have been so extremely complex that it's taken many hours of time to process a game phase due to so many actions and their interactions.  I find those kind of games most fun personally because they really allow a lot of creativity with roles and powers, and there is a lot of game theory that goes into the setups you create to determine if it's a fair/balanced game for all parties to have a chance to win.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
