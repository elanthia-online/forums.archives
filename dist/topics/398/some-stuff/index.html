<p>A Tier-3 unlocked piece of mechanical shifting jewelry.
This wraithaline bracer is Tier 3 (out of a possible 4) and uses the verbs RUB to change gems and TAP to morph.  Only the GEM (crystal of shadowy wraithaline) may be altered.  The following gem slots are available for customization by willing merchants:</p>

<p>slot 1: star-shaped mistvein diamond
slot 2: dragon-shaped Alhan'aht rivertear
slot 3: purple black thunderhead opal
slot 4: crystal of shadowy wraithaline
slot 5: rune-etched golden blazestar
slot 6: mitre-shaped ruby
default setting: firestone - cannot be altered</p>

<p>You can tell that the bracer is as light as it can get.
Can shift into a bracer, emblem, band, talisman, or earring.
Rubbing changes the material to one of the inset gems or the firestone base.
Currently is "a sigil-covered wraithaline bracer" just for example.
