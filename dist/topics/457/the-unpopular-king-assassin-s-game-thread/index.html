<p>First, the standard rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>You may only talk about this game in this thread ~~and in an appropriately named spoiler in the Discussion Thread~~. If you are not playing this game, you may not post in this thread.</li>
<li>You may not play to lose. This will be dealt with at the mod's discretion (expect an immediate modkill if you play against your faction).</li>
<li>Do not lurk. Replacements are not an option. Be active and don't put yourself in the position to be modkilled please.</li>
<li>You may not edit your posts.</li>
<li>You may not post your role PM, or quote verbatim from it. You may paraphrase.</li>
<li>Votes and questions must be posted in</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>bold, on a newline.</strong></p>

<p>You may also ask questions to the mod in PM.
7. You may not post game content in this thread after you are dead. (You may post death flavor.) If you are lynched, you are dead when the deadline is reached. Else, you are dead when the mod says so.
8. ~~You may not post game content at night. It is night when the aforementioned deadline is reached.~~  This is a night-less game setup, once someone is lynched, the next phase will start.
9. You may not devise codes or otherwise arrange to pass information along as a means of trying to break the game.  This also covers a general play in the spirit of the game and fairplay catch-all.
10. The mod's decisions are final.</p>

<p>At this time, due to limitation of the forums, I do not think spoiler tags exist, and as such, a discussion thread would be impossible to have without them.  If someone can figure them out, then we could have one, but I've spent enough time looking and trying, and can't see how to do them in any guides. :(</p>

<p>=====================================  </p>

<p><strong>General INFO:</strong></p>

<p>The Assassin has one kill that they can use at any time during the game, typically after being lynched. Their goal is to identify the King so that they can use this kill against him. If the Assassin successfully kills the King, then they win, otherwise the King and Guards win. The Assassin doesn't need to survive to win.</p>

<p>This setup differs from normal mafia in that the "town" has more information than the "mafia" does. Every Guard that is lynched narrows the number of targets the Assassin must consider, so the challenge for the Guards is to find out who the Assassin is as quickly as possible without giving away the identity of the King. </p>

<p>===================================  </p>

<p><strong>Role List:</strong></p>

<p>===================  </p>

<p><em>The kingdom had thrived for centuries under the just and skillful guidance of the of Lucas family line.  Unfortunately, the last prince had not attended to the lessons of court very well, and when he came to power, amid questionable circumstances, the country started to decay.  He was abusive towards the people, more concerned with his own pleasures than the well being of the country, and had started numerous conflicts with neighboring states for his own amusement.  He did however, have the sense to treat his private guard well, allowing them to take many liberties by assuming the role, and thus he was kept safe from the public, and those within court, who would rather see him dead.</em>  </p>

<p><em>A small group within the countries military ranks had decided that enough was enough, and so they contracted an outside group of assassin's, seeking assistance in dealing with their troublesome king.  Getting word of this through a network of spies, the king summoned his personal guard, but soon realized there were more of them than there should be.  Thus, the hunt for the assassin would start!</em></p>

<p>I'm sure that Flimbo's reasons are marmot-related, but for myself I'll admit I was being flippant. My thinking was that it doesn't matter who we vote for in the first round. The assassin isn't going to accidentally say "I'm an assassin." We need to vote to learn. Unfortunately, the assassin also learns from our votes, so doing anything is a double-edged sword.</p>

<p>Since then I've thought more, and have a proposal. We are six. One is assassin, and knows only the assassin. One is king, and knows only the king. But four are guards, and they each know TWO people: king and him/her self (as guard).</p>

<p>The king and assassin have a 1 in 5 chance to guess. Guards have 1 in 4. We can use this.</p>

<p>The primary obstacle to us now is that the assassin is watching and learning from what we say. If we vote for different people, the assassin learns about us from our voting. Since we cannot reliably pick the assassin the first time out, it is very important that we ALL vote for the same person each round. That way the assassin learns nothing.</p>

<p>I propose this: We all vote to kill the same person.  It doesn't matter who, as long as we don't pick the king. The person we pick votes LAST and whomever they vote for, that's who we all vote for next. Repeat until assassin is dead.</p>

<p>In all rounds except the very first, the pick is guaranteed to be by a guard (we know cause they're dead) and that means we can trust it as not being the king AND as having best available odds to get assassin (1 in 4, then 1 in 3, and so on).</p>

<p>Everyone who is not the assassin can pick someone other than the king. If we kill the assassin, s/he gets to guess at the king and then the game ends. (And since by following this system we've given away no clues, the guess is as hard as it can be.) If we kill ANYONE else, they were a guard and there is a 1 in 4 chance that they named the assassin, so we should all vote for the person they named. The next time, odds will be 1 in 3. We will out the assassin quickly and, so long as we all vote the same way, our votes reveal nothing about the king's identity.</p>

<p>Since we all win as long as the king lives, this should be optimal play for everyone except the assassin.</p>

<p>I'm already an accused assassin, so I won't try to pick the first to die. But I will vote with whomever votes next, and ask all others to do the same except - and this is vital - if you are the one we pick, please vote last and we will all kill next whomever you name. Unless you were the assassin, in which case, see ya!</p></div></article><article id="post-4793" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Eva</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 12:20:57 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>K, even though my King sounds kind of shitty, it is my duty and sworn oath to protect his life.</p>

Pretty sure I made some missteps and gave Flimbo away, but at least I finally figured out that wiley assassin!</p></div></article><article id="post-4881" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Claudaro</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 8:42:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>That game went by pretty quick, which is generally good for town in this case.  JNewhall actually put forth a pretty solid strat that if followed, would have helped IMO.  Ya'll speed lynched him so fast though you didn't give him a chance to post who to target next.  I think Flimbo played the king role too boldly in my opinion, and when you didn't call him on some of it or kept letting him slide, I took that as a pretty strong indication that he was the king, Maylan.</p>

<p>I'm on the fence about trying to run another game here.  I enjoy doing it and hope that folks enjoy playing, but we just need more folks playing.  If there is sufficient interest, I'd run another, but without that, I dunno.  Any mafia game less than 7 is pretty hard to balance for a newbie game, and alt games like this one, several exist for 5-6 players, but, like this, they go pretty quickly and are easy to determine optimal strats and just follow them mechanically.</p></div></article><article id="post-4883" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Eva</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 8:59:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Congrats @HJFudge, you sneaky assassin! This was fun, if shorter than I anticipated.

<p>I would like to play this game again. I think people who are used to mafia get thrown by the assassin game. The town has to lie in the assassin game, because we only win if we trick the assassin into picking the wrong person. That's an added wrinkle that I like.</p></div></article><article id="post-4886" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 11:06:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Long live King Flimcarl!

<p>And for the record, Claudaro, my play may seem bold and stabby, and that's because it is, but five games from now when all of my plays have all been bold and stabby, noooobody will know what's going on.</p></div></article><article id="post-4888" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Claudaro</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 11:22:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>That is true Flimbo.  It is also true that I tend to play boldly as well and gambit frequently.  It is also true that I have a tendency to get lynched early out of inability to read me and fear of what I'll pull off late game if I'm allowed to go unchecked and am anti town.  It's a double edged sword.  The more stuff you pull off to get away with, the more of a target you paint on yourself in future games as someone who can not be allowed to live to the endgame.</p></div></article><article id="post-4907" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, September 10th, 2017, 4:46:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Speaking of which, you should be able to play next game if you want!
