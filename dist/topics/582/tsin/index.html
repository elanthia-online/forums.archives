<p>No fixskills.  Must be a character transfer, no account takeovers on this one.  Has the bonded pure corasine flamberge and bonded whistle that summons a crate as your disk.  Black ora heart &amp; Carousel from EG.  Couple of enhances in there that boost lockpicking.  Blotched leather bladder is the one that boosts perception and is a pickpocket protection.  Tried to get all the info out there I could, if you have questions go for it.</p>
