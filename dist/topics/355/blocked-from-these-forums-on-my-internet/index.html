From what I understand, because the service operates as a gateway, and the router is tied to the modem, as a single unit, all of its advanced functionality is locked by Charter. I did find a very long work around, but I don't know that I really want to go that far into it, since it could cause issues with my ISP.</p></div></article><article id="post-3575" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 27th, 2017, 7:48:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>ahh gotcha.

<p>So apparently the .online TLD isn't resolvable on Charter DNS servers (71.10.216.1 &amp; 71.10.216.2). Just got off phone with their 3rd escalation tier. Spectrum created a ticket to have their engineers look at the issue and should call me back tomorrow. I'll let everyone know once they call back tomorrow with what the current situation is.</p>

<p>You can bypass the issue by either changing your Router or PC to use alternative DNS servers until Charter(spectrum) gets their act together.
