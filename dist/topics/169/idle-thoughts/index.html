<p>601</p>

<p>602 perhaps with high lore or high ranger ranks can be made a mass spell to save on endless casting for player spell ups?</p>

<p>603 can this please be added to multi cast for spelling up? and make duration similar to the other ranger spells</p>

<p>604 </p>

<p>605   'whisper' to 'several players at once to save multi whispering 605 active  whisper name name name  'message'</p>

<p>606</p>

<p>607</p>

<p>608 (cast at other version with lore and wearing Hues, to 'hide/conceal' (no AS bonus)  others (such as escorts or wounded PC's/companions or rangers companion animal)  basically invis but target cant move or comes from hiding) </p>

<p>609 sunburst effect when targeted seems to last a very short duration when target is like level,  perhaps lasts longer with lores?  could 'targetted version' with MOC and Lore get multiple targets when cast (IE splash for targeted blind effect)</p>

<p>610 (post cap creatures more and more are above level 100, this leaves the spell less useful for rangers since spell is currently level based.  Would aid post cap by having 'lore or ranger ranks to add to level base for effectiveness'</p>

<p>611</p>

<p>612 </p>

<p>613 Has some limited 'Aiming' for aimed ranged.  Would be great if it was also for thrown and spell aim?   aiming being aiming</p>

<p>614  </p>

<p>615 Spell dismisses too quickly if target hides, perhaps can 'search' for hidden target or move on to next target in room?</p>

<p>Perhaps swarm when cast on dead PC, can be used to slowly drag the body or aid in carrying the body (for rangers that do not have dog or cat comanions)</p>

<p>616</p>

<p>617</p>

<p>618</p>

<p>619</p>

<p>620 Resistance  chain for self cast rangers? post cap?  maybe lore requirement mid 50's bless lore? perhaps shorter duration? I think most metal armor types had 'leather or cloth-padding underneath it.</p>

<p>635 fury  invoke or incant 'Player safe choice version?  do not want to lose aggressive version choice</p>

<p>650  Aspect Bear  could assume bear (if running 650 already)   get a chance to break a Stun if assumed when stunned or running when stunned.   Adds constitution or perhaps could remove xxx rounds of stun if assumed or running when stunned</p>

<p>Companion
After testing, they seem to 'search' for hidden and invisible, when they stand after sleeping, it is very good.  It would help if they 'searched' anytime something was ambushing ranger/ranger group or on command when ranger using 'tell companion scout'  by first searching rangers room for hidden and invis, then running off to send back info on enemy/friendlies in adjacent rooms</p>

<p>Stunned rangers and Companions <br />
Perhaps companion could 'automatically'  guard or  drag a ranger from a room when ranger is stunned?  As an option instead of just attack.</p>

<p>Companion non leathal attacks, perhaps a mode where companion does 'knock downs' or trips instead of eating target </p>

<p>Ability to tell companions to do commands with ranger whisper at distance?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, just some idle thoughts.</p>

<p>This feature alone would make me want to play my ranger more.</p></div></article><article id="post-1722" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ragz</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 11:26:46 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>destrier said in <a href="/post/1509">Idle thoughts</a>:</p>

<p>Other spells that have been reviewed within the last several years that were given that treatment received target-limited versions for cast(safe)/evoke(hostile). Personally, one of the more frightening aspects of 635 and 1030 is the fact that they are natively-hostile primary sphere  aoe spells. </p>

<p>A review of the spell would all but guarantee a reduction in aggressiveness~</p></div></article><article id="post-2731" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Destrier</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 21st, 2017, 9:41:51 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>CMAN 
Side by Side working with the rangers companion</p>

<p>Recent MIU and Arcane scroll update. <br />
Currently, only 1x skill possible in both.  With the new updates to the skills benefit only pures and bards.  A consideration on MIU being moved to 2x. Putting rangers back into a position of in the middle of Bards and Paladins on the magic side of semi's.</p>

<p>From ranger description:   A ranger is a jack-of-all-trades, having skill costs that allow a character to excel at almost any endeavor whether they be physically or magically focused, although not all at one time.</p>

Get in line with wizards on that one!</p>

<p>635, sadly, the implication is that it no longer hits EVERYTHING... I'm looking at you 518... You get one that hits like, 10 if you're unsafe, and 5 if you're safe...  Then everyone uses the unsafe that doesn't hit everything... lose-lose</p></div></article><article id="post-3223" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Destrier</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 5:35:28 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>613 Was  thinking it would add to the hidden roll to hit a vital area actually.</p></div></article><article id="post-5420" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Destrier</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 25th, 2017, 7:44:37 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Another thought on Aspect bear, it would be really helpful if we could change aspects when in rt or stunned.
