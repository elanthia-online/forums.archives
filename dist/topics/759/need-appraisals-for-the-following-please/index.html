If somebody wouldn't mind, can they please appraise the following blades? No, I'm not selling them all (obviously I'm going to keep one of the 8x blades) but I'm considering my options since I'm strongly considering going back to dual wielding paladin.</p>

<p>That said:</p>

<p>1) 8x OLD STYLE (falchion based), T5 ensorcelled, Bubble flaring, Lesser Mood, blessable katana (max light)</p>

<p>2) 6x Adamadine wakizashi (max light)</p>

<p>3) 8x veil iron katana (two hander) with 26 points of damage weighting in addition to it's natural crit weight.  It also has greater void flares and is max light in addition the illegal alter</p>

<p>4) a blackened mithril greathelm.  This has retractable fire flares.  I have seen it go as high as 60 points of damage.</p>

<p>Thanks</p></div></article><article id="post-8229" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 12th, 2018, 4:04:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>are they greater or lesser bubble flares?</p></div></article><article id="post-8230" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 12th, 2018, 4:06:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What's the katana look like?

<p>For the bubble flare, it's Lesesr bubble flare from DR.</p></div></article><article id="post-8233" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 12th, 2018, 5:06:12 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I know it's not real adamantine.

the shortsword is worth around 25, sadly adamantine is an awful offhand choice for many races.
the veil iron katana, I have no idea, i'd probably auction it.</p></div></article><article id="post-8257" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Falvicar</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, January 14th, 2018, 12:47:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Old style appraisal is rather disappointing.  I'd thought it net at least 200m.   Mooted point atm though as I caved and went back to dual wielding to use it. </p>

<p>I'm still curious on the old style blade.   That was not cheap to get to 8x (especially being veil iron), let alone adding the greater void flares and the 26 service points towards damage weighting and counting.  I'm considering selling it still if it's worthwhile enough.  Otherwise eventually I'll relearn how to use it.</p></div></article><article id="post-8258" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, January 14th, 2018, 12:50:28 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>No way it reaches 200m without being 10x with a ton of weighting, honestly. Lesser Mood is fluff, and Lesser Bubble certainly won't push it that high. If it had a bunch of weighting and Greater Elemental flares, maybe.</p>

<p>My 6x MCW T5 falchion isn't even worth 200m. I did get a 150m offer on it, but turned it down because it's my Duskruin and bandit blade.</p></div></article><article id="post-8261" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Falvicar</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, January 14th, 2018, 6:52:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm likely going to be greater voids on it and add weighting since I honestly don't think the bubbles are worthwhile anymore.  Plus I'm already paladin bonding to it anyway so I might as well as the crit weighting once able.   I intend to do the same with my offhand</p>

<p>Sheer curiousity:  Has anybody ever been able to use an adamantine blade and actually see it disarm or break a weapon?   So far I've yet to see that so I'm a little disappointed and I'm already using my own wizard to start enchanting an eonake wakizashi as high they are able to to get it 8x so I can then add the other nifty flares (like making it T5, adding the greater flare of sort, and/or adding weighting).   Seems like adamantine is more troublesome than it's worth so far.  I'm still keeping it though.</p>

<p>Hopefully Duskruin shows comes in April,</p></div></article><article id="post-8279" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, January 15th, 2018, 5:43:29 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I have an adamantine star, and I've seen it disarm a few times.  It's not frequent by any means.  You have to parry the attack for a chance to have it trigger.  And then it's a really low chance even then.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
