<p>I propose that you'll be able to climb one "level" of padding per event if you use all 25 services.  So this event, if you have heavy padding, you'll be able to get very heavily padded armor.</p>

<p>Previously you could jump from heavy to masterful.  Now it's going to take 4 events (2 years) to reach the upper level of masterful.</p></div></article><article id="post-2773" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Arshwikk</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 8:48:45 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If this god awful scale were real we'd have to spend 10k real life dollars to heavy pad something...especially since we've already seen the scale from 0-25 for various hypothetical items. Based on whatever seed THAT uses, the 13k plain 6x would be like 2m BS by heavy. The reality is that driving away newer players or ones who have comparatively little with dream crushing systems is not the way to secure a future for GS. I would "speculate" that it's not this bad. Granted, this proposed system would be great for converted armors for those who bought 200 pairs of the drama armor. However, if <em>I</em> were in charge, I punish that kind of greed by making it possible for anyone to earn their own with a reasonable amount of work.</p></div></article><article id="post-2775" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 9:09:54 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@mogonis said in <a href="/post/2757">Theorycrafting Padding/Weighting Changes</a>:</p>
