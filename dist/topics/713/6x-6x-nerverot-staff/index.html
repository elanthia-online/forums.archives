It is a fully unlocked nervestaff, 6x with 6x acuity and rotlflares. It is also t5 ensorcelled and max light. I have linked some information if you want the details on it. And for reference, the starting price for a rotflare cert was 225k bloodscrip. </p>

<p>This staff has four flares: rotflare, acuity, ensorcell, and the defensive/offensive nervestaff flare</p>

<p>It is attuned.</p>

<p>Willing to accept cash, bloodscrip, silvers or trades. </p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>You hurl a seething blast of steam at a dark-crested basilisk!
AS: +589 vs DS: +299 with AvD: +44 + d100 roll: +9 = +343
... and hit for 132 points of damage!
Boiling stream strikes right arm! Steamed, not fried.
The dark-crested basilisk wails loudly as it cradles its wounded right foreleg.</p>

<p><em>* A sickly green aura radiates from a cane-length helical lor scepter capped with smooth dark vaalin and seeps into a dark-crested basilisk's wounds! *</em></p>

<p>... 40 points of damage!
Skull shatters into sharp spikes which are driven into the dark-crested basilisk's brain.
The dark-crested basilisk emits a final hiss and dies.</p></div></article><article id="post-7898" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Red</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, December 16th, 2017, 1:02:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>SOLD</p></div></article></div></body></html>
