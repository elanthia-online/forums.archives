I am curious if anyone has bumped themselves from premium to prime after being on premium for a small period of time (half a year).  Any prep I should take?  I know I am going to lose all my locker spaces but just curious if anyone has any advice for dealing with the transition?</p></div></article><article id="post-5187" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, September 17th, 2017, 2:20:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Not sure there's anything to physically do other than clearing lockers and your FWI bank account.

<p>Locker space has often been the singular reason I've not bumped my account down to basic.

Premium becomes much more worthwhile at cap, when you can take Mogonis' advice and more easily create groups for things like capped bandits in FWI, utilizing the free Reim runs, etc, etc.  Multiple characters also reduces the effective marginal price.</p>

<p>Not mentioned here is selling can be advantageous (especially Dark Elves) in FWI to sell compared to many towns.</p></div></article><article id="post-5300" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 9:53:50 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin Yep on the fence. If they would allow one premium account to log 2 characters at the same time, mainly for spellups, I would upgrade to prem in a heartbeat.</p></div></article><article id="post-5308" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 21st, 2017, 12:09:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I also love access to the warcamps in the FWI wild. I decided to stay the course a little longer. Every time I want to downgrade my wizard to my spellbot I hunt with it and realize I can never hunt with a 3+ second RT again. So I just added FA and survival for more bounties and tanked my rogue to only pick boxes!</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback folks all great reasons and they did help</p></div></article></div></body></html>
