<p>On the fifth day of ESN, the messaging for transferring wounds was updated! To go along with this change, custom messaging options for TRANSFER have been added.</p>

<p>To celebrate this change, two raffles have been set up in Prime and Platinum in the Wehnimer's Landing empath guild. The first raffle will have three winners who will each be able to choose from one of the six premade customization options, and the second raffle's winner will be worked with to get a completely unique customized set of TRANSFER messaging.</p>

<p>The list of premade customization options can be found at: https://gswiki.play.net/TRANSFER_(verb)</p>

<p>Hi everybody!</p>

<p>Having read feedback from a fair number of players at this point, I've decided to swap the standard messaging with what was previously the "Custom Style: Concentration." So now the previously new standard messaging is called "Custom Style: Light Touch" and the new standard messaging doesn't involve touching your patients.</p>

<p>I've also updated the messaging for TRANSFER so that it will only show the "Initial Transfer" messaging when the transfer effect is not present. This should allow for a better flow to healing while also helping it be less spammy!</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
