<p>The first is <strong>A Congress of Collectibles</strong> at <strong>4pm</strong> in the <strong>Ebonstone Manor, House Pub</strong>.
House Sylvanfair would like to thank everyone who attended their events last year and participated in their collectibles challenge. Anyone with a bracelet or game case filled with 3 or more items is invited to attend an hour-long <strong>private</strong> merchant session in the Ebonstone Manor. The merchant will endeavor to work for as many as possible but please be aware that the order will be determined by the number of items collected (those with 5 or more going first).</p>

<ul>
<li>Please remember to bring your bracelet or case for verification *</li>
</ul>

<p>The second event is <strong>HOUSE</strong> at <strong>6pm</strong>, again in the Ebonstone Manor, House Pub.
House Sylvanfair invite you to join them for an evening of charming company and a few games of HOUSE (the CHE equivalent of GHOUL) to welcome in the New Year. Learn more about this yearâ€™s collectible challenge and how you can participate to win BIG at the end of the year! See below or our <a href="https://gswiki.play.net/House_Sylvanfair#Events">wiki page</a> for more details.</p>

<p><strong>NEWS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR 2018</strong></p>

<p>Starting with our first event in January, House Sylvanfair will be relaunching their successful and popular incentive scheme where everyone who participates in our events during the year will be given a collectible themed-prize and a chance to win BIG at the end of the year!</p>

<p>Participants will again have two choices: to collect charms for a charm bracelet or contents for a gaming case. If you missed out last year, you can pick up a bracelet or case at the launch event on day 13 of the month Lormesta (Saturday, 13th January) to start you off. The door prizes available throughout the year will then be a choice of a charm for your bracelet or game for your case, so even if you don't ultimately qualify for the BIG prize, you'll still have something to show for it! </p>

<p>As a thank you to everyone that took part last year, we will be offering the opportunity to collect BOTH prizes this year, for example, continue to collect new charms for your bracelet AND start collecting games (old or new) for a case, or vice versa. </p>

<p>There will be a total of 10 new charms and games available to collect at events during the year (as well as the 10 from last year). Don't worry if you can't make the first event, they will be available again. As before, House Sylvanfair members will automatically be given a bracelet or case on request and one charm or game of their choosing to get them started, so if you're interested in joining the House and want to have a head start, let us know!</p>

<p>What is the BIG prize, I hear you ask! At the end of the year, those who have collected 5 or more charms or games will be invited to a private merchant session lasting ONE hour.</p>

<p>We hope you'll join in and have fun collecting your prizes. Please don't hesitate to contact Rohese (or any of the other officers) if you have any questions!</p></div></article><article id="post-8221" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rohese</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 12th, 2018, 12:02:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Reminder that this is tomorrow!</p></div></article><article id="post-8244" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rohese</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, January 13th, 2018, 6:54:38 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Did you manage to collect 3 or more door prizes from Sylvanfair events last year?
