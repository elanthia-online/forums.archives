<li>a crown-capped white faewood runestaff
The runestaff appears remarkably rough-hewn.  With its rough burls and unfinished surface, it seems less a staff than a slender faewood stripped of its bark and branches.  At the staff's head, five fingers of faewood clutch a gleaming crown of pure gold.  A faint aura of holy magic seems to radiate from the crown and course down the staff itself.  You see nothing unusual, except for a small enchanter's glyph.</li>

<p>+40, max light, 6x acuity added, SK 306 with enough SL-religion RANKS to add acid degeneration flares. This comes in a scaling design that starts at 10 RANKS if you have none and caps at 30 additional ranks if you train 20 of your own (Not 100% on the 20 but if I remember right that is what I had to get 50 total ranks, 30 being from the staff - and I do mean RANKS)</p>
