<p>Going forward all public infrastructure things related to FEO will exist in <a href="https://github.com/elanthia-online/forums">this repo</a></p>

<p>If you would like to audit/make PRs/open issues and generally contribute to the health of this community in a more technical way, this is your place to do it.  I know we have a lot of technical people that have brought up wanting to contribute, so I want to provide a reasonable platform for doing this.</p>

<p>I am trying to keep as much of the devops/sysadmin stuff in Ruby as possible as it seems there are a lot of Ruby developers, so maybe we can capitalize on that.</p>

<p>over time I will add known contributors to the organization if they desire and hopefully we will achieve a critical mass of contributors to have some sort of federated approach to improving the technical aspects of this community.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Forking the current theme &amp; adding it to this repo</li>
<li>Adding plugin recreation to Docker builds so admins don't have to go through a bunch of headache with every upgrade</li>
<li>Add my cron entry scripts to the monorepo that handle backups</li>
<li>Actually work on the theme to improve accessibility and other issues</li>
<li>sanitize and publish the <code>config.json</code> file that controls FEO so quickstart is a bit easier</li>
</ol>

<p>Node makes my life so much easier on a day-to-day basis, but then I'm playing massive amounts of catch up going from two-three web design classes to having coded entire sites in less than six months. NPM, laravel elixir and github have made worlds of difference!</p>

<p>Ditto on the P.S.</p></div></article><article id="post-3916" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">SpiffyJr</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 8:46:16 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Laravel?!

<p>ROFL. I'm given two options at my company. Wordpress and Laravel. I just finished a site in wordpress and while it's 100000x more end-user friendly, the backend was a clusterfuck of epic proportions and took almost twice the amount of time. </p>

<p>With Laravel, it felt like I went straight from Point A to Point B in while creating customizable components. With Wordpress I was getting to Point B from Point A via Point X-Y-Z. </p>

<p>What kind of frameworks do you prefer to build in?</p></div></article><article id="post-3972" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 5:02:48 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p><a href="http://phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> if I have my druthers, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> is usually when I don't.</p></div></article><article id="post-3974" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 5:05:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Phoenix looks really interesting.

Seriously, how the hell did a language with such a shitty concurrency model ever become mainstream.</p>

<p>Anyway, I develop all my sites using Go for the backend API and Angular for the front-end. If it's required I'll run express to render the site server-side and transition to a single page app. Usually this isn't the case so it's just nginx serving static files and all the data comes from an API.</p>

<p>I have a super simple Go API running on a 0.5 core / 1 GB memory box on Google Cloud that's handling 10 to 40 million requests a day. This is one of the many reasons why Go is amazing and I urge anyone wanting to be serious about web development and performance to at least look at it.</p></div></article><article id="post-4041" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 9:13:35 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@spiffyjr Thanks for that, I'll look into it. I'm bound to whatever my backend developer chooses to work with (when he's not forced to work with Wordpress), but I can always make suggestions.

<p>That's a quote from the Node founder who quit the project and is now working at Google in one of their fancy schmancy brain thingies.</p>

<p>Node's concurrency model is not awful, it just requires understanding of Futures and other asynchronous concepts instead of them being abstracted away by some runtime scheduler.  If i was to assign arbitrary comparisons between the two languages, I would say that the greatest advantage of Go is strong types, however writing even simple error handling in Go is absolutely awful compared to many other languages (in my opinion Elixir has the best error handling model possible)</p>

<p>All in all, there are lots of tradeoffs between languages, Go is very good at what it does (and generally I personally also like a language that has compile time guarantees), but it's also sometimes really annoying when prototyping.</p>

<p>*I do not write Go on the day-to-day, I really only do it for experimental side projects.</p></div></article><article id="post-4148" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">SpiffyJr</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 2nd, 2017, 9:07:34 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What good is it to be a developer if you can't force your dislike of languages on other developers?!</p></div></article><article id="post-4450" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 11:18:01 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I hate everything equally.

Somebody said Wordpress. I heard it from afar. WORDPRESS IS AWFUL. How dare you even speak its name?! It's what web design would look like if all web design were descended from AOL Pagemaker and then it was ported to Mac OS 7.1 then translated into Arabic by someone who only speaks French and then back to English by dogs but instead of translating it the dogs got drunk and spilled a bunch of dog beer on the code and it got all smudged so they hastily tried to rewrite it in QBASIC while they were still pretty buzzed. Then the dogs uploaded it to GoDaddy and said "Who needs php turned on? Look! Danica Patrick! Also try our CMS!"</p>

<p>You heard it here first. Wordpress is a CMS designed by drunken french arabic dogs in QBASIC for Mac OS 7 at the request of America Online. It's a widely believed FACT.</p>

<p>TL;DR - I'm planning to check out what I can fiddle with on Github later tonight. Thanks for putting that up.</p></div></article><article id="post-4481" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 4:34:22 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm working on how to best manage the forks and bringing them into the monorepo but these are the two forks that will be added :
