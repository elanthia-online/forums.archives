I had some serious suspicions going in (as per my posts) but… it was absolutely fantastic! Especially, how the Simucoin transactions were setup.</p>

<p>I know we’re only halfway through but for the important bits (games &amp; fishing) this was a stunning success. I’m sure you measure success on a different metric (US dollars) but I suspect that those numbers will turn out to far exceed your expectations. In terms of player perspective (apart from some minor customer service/public relations breakdowns at the start) every simucoin transaction, every RNG game, every encounter with staff to the really cool items this year was spot on ! Congrats, I think this is going to turn out to be THE greatest EG ever!</p>

<p>Some suggestions…</p>

<p>Since I now know you’re a reasonably bright guy with a talent for this (believe me a lot of game designers are self-deluded incompetents) I’m posing these suggestions as merely possiblities. I’m sure you can improve on many of them.</p>

<p>1.) The DSD didn’t feel like Delirium Manor, at least not quite. That is to say it didn’t feel like I was hunched over a slot machine with my eyes glazed over pulling that lever again and again. I think this can be improved even further with the addition of puzzles that could award you with seashells or better luck for the next few minutes.</p>

<p>Example. You spot a dented locker embedded between some rocks!</p>

<p>The objective here is to figure out the three number combination on the locker from a riddle scrawled on the side of the locker. 60 second timer.</p>

<p>I also think puzzles like this will have the added benefit of detering scripters. Most importantly it’ll attract more participants or a segment of the population who might not otherwise participate in these type of “gambling” events.</p>

<p>2.) Please make a system to participate in the digging games through the Simucoin store as well as silvers. My characters aren’t that advanced and I actually found myself following my group around the event but being stopped at the games because of the lack of in-game silvers.</p>

<p>3.) More Multi-tiered/part versions of the same piece of gear. I think jackpots are great but a T4/T5 that has potential to be something greater (locked) is almost as sweet (at least that’s how I personally feel). The collecting of pieces of a whole item is also very tantalizing. Say a mechanical helmet could be one part of a ten part set to form a complete “Ironman” suit. Each piece is just a T5, after assembling all ten it becomes a T6. Pretty cool!</p>

<p>In conclusion, you did great, plain and simple. I was hesitant at first but I am at this point thoroughly convinced of the merits of these types of microtransactions. Hope to see more great things from you and your team in the future!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
