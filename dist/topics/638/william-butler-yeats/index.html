The falcon cannot hear the falconer; 
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, 
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned; 
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity. </p>

<p>Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi 
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert <br />
A shape with lion body and the head of a man, <br />
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, <br />
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.</p>

<p>The darkness drops again; but now I know <br />
That twenty centuries of stony sleep 
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? </p>
