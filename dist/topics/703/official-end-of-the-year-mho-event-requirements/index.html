<p>Hello again everyone!</p>

<p>I've sent another e-mail out to MHO officers whose organizations are in danger of demotion or removal from the system, but I wanted to post here as well in hopes that I can get in contact with them.</p>

<p>If you are an officer in one of the following organizations, please check your inbox or contact me as soon as possible:</p>

<p>Moonshine Manor
Clan Jakarta
The Ardenai Temple Knights
The Coterie of the Swan
The Eahnor Assembly
The Order of the Azure Sun
Beautifully Awkward Elanthians
Guardians of Elanthia
The Order of the Umbral Moon
The Magicians</p>
