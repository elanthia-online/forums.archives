<p>Hey folks,</p>

<p>I've opened up the Smithy and you can now go ahead and purchase your services. I am currently updating the first batch of reported scripts and will post again when I have done so.</p>

<p>I have also added a new question you can ask the assistant about (ASK ASSISTANT ABOUT SPECIAL). If your item is scripted, the assistant will be able to tell you whether the script has been reviewed or not for costing purposes. If your script has not been reviewed and you feel the item's combat properties deriving from the script are not powerful enough to warrant the full cost modifier, please use the BUGITEM command targeting the item in question with the problem description of "Please review this item's script cost for weighting/padding/sighting."</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Coase</p>

<p>If you were overcharged by the smithy, you’ll need to ASSIST so that we can check out your circumstances and refend appropriately. There was a pricing bug for the first 30 minutes or so where you were being charged for the wrong step and another where you were incorrectly allowed to purchase more than 25 services (which is easy to miss if you’re buying a lot all at once).</p>

<p>Hey everyone, we're seeing a lot of bugitem reports on functional/mechanical scripts. Anything that impacts combat is giving you the proper price. Examples would be returners, IthzirArmor, VolnArmor, etc. There are some areas where surcharges might not be as high, and that is an area where we are trying to cover. Priority is getting fluff scripts under control.</p>

<p>I just want to set you guys up with expectations that if there is a combat benefit, you're likely seeing the proper price or close to it.</p>

<p>My only nitpick is:</p>

<p>Combat
Effectiveness    Services</p>

<p>It's less confusing (IMO) described as:</p>

<p>CE = PP = Padding Points
Services = SP = Service Points</p></div></article><article id="post-4074" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 12:49:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>But it's not just Padding, so that might confuse another way (and people will ask for the weighting and sighting scales).</p></div></article></div></body></html>
