<p>I've gone ahead and opened the bloodforge and smelter. The blacksmith assistant in the workshop is just a husk right now. You can go ahead and transmute pendants or try out the new smelter. The smelter area works like the one at Ebon Gate. Just ASK MINER about COST and ASK MINER about ORE.</p>

<p>We're still working on the smithy. More information will be posted about weighting/padding before the smithy opens.</p>

<p>I understand details have been scarce (though I did read the vague teaser about number of 'services' and their cost), but I was trying to figure out... is this the point at which weighting/padding will be able to be added to flaring items?  Or do I need to be looking to get a 'vanilla' item worked on?  The best thing I have that would benefit (at least at the moment) is some nice flaring UAC gear, but if I need to pursue something else, I can do that.  Just not sure if we know yet what the parameters are going to be.</p></div></article><article id="post-2779" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">OldSkool</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 10:02:02 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There are some rather important unknowns at this time.

<p>I hadn't considered that.. so a single invite might just mean getting +1 point of padding or weighting on an item, or something similar.  That would... well, it wouldn't be pleasant.  But I take your overall meaning.  We're in 'wait and see' mode for now.</p></div></article><article id="post-2801" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 12:44:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I got the impression that you could do all 25 on a single invite, based on Discord chatter.

<p>I would back that a Proper, full-time CM would be a huge help.  Wyrom has said he wants a more modern approach, and that position is part of modern. </p>

<p>That person could also help... soften... some of the more coarse GM's messaging/language.  I have commented before that a couple of them could stand from having a PR Person (they know what they're doing, but lord do they need somebody who knows how to say things).</p></div></article><article id="post-2807" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 1:12:16 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex said in <a href="/post/2804">Official: Duskruin - August 2017 - Bloodforge and Smelter Open</a>:

<p>So much this.  Seriously.  There have been a few GM interactions where I've had to make all kinds of allowances for tone and things, and try and see what they were actually getting at.  One of these interactions recently at the Premium Fest is what made my wife stop playing altogether.  Wyrom usually does a very good job being open, honest and blunt (which I appreciate more than I can say), but not all of them have the ability to come across well in an unscripted, extemporaneous forum.</p></div></article><article id="post-2835" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 2:52:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'll start looking on Indeed for a CM for a $50 salary, assuming we give 100% of all that booklet to the CM.</p>

<p>I hate it, because I like TES :p.</p>

<p>The reason TES was a GREAT series is that after a short while, you eventually become a god.  You can walk anywhere in the world, and just flatten anything that stands in your way.  Sure, you start out where a bear can kill you, and those giants were dangerous for a while, but eventually, you get to the point where you can Crit kill the final boss in the game with a single arrow.</p>

<p>This doesn't translate well to MMOs.</p></div></article><article id="post-2852" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">OldSkool</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 3:27:37 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex
