<p>1) <strong>a wyvern-etched iron hunting hatchet - $1200</strong>
- Tally weapon with a T5 ensorcell</p>

<p><em>The hatchet's expertly crafted thick iron head has been deeply etched into the form of a wyvern grasping the ruic haft, its eyes staring outward as tiny blazestars that are set into the hollow sockets. Stretching back from the body, the wyvern's wings come together to form the sharpened crescent edged blade of the weapon. Cut and polished to bring out a soft crimson sheen, the ruic haft arcs slightly towards the front of the weapon to provide the best grip for attacking. A strange necrotic haze radiates from the hatchet. You see the resemblance of faded tally marks down the haft of your hatchet.</em></p>
