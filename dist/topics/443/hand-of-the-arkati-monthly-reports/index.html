<p><strong>Writeup:</strong>
Welcome to the new forums and a huge catch-up post to mention everything that we've been doing.  For those that don't know, we are the Hand of the Arkati.  We are a capped hunting MHO that performs events on at least a daily basis.  We have three event structures:  Official events are those on the calendar.  Unofficial are those not on the calendar, but occurring at our normal time, and then we have impromptu events where our more seasoned individuals are leading runs during off-hours, but there is sufficient interest/marketing/etc.</p>

<p>The MHO has been in existence since 7/11/2016, and grew in popularity with the release of Reim.  For non-premium members, it's incredibly likely that someone within the organization is willing to sell a use of a Reim orb for an entry, and we also do warcamping every other week.  We arrange our runs and such via our Discord Server.  With 25 people... it's a hell of a lot easier than trying to reading a one-line say from someone.</p>

<p>Individuals under 91 are only allowed to attend our Wednesday farm nights (that means we don't leave the plaza, we just rinse/repeat kills/reorbing/etc to gain lots of loot, lots of scrip, and chat on Discord).  This is because to get tags on critters, you need to be within 10 levels of the person that the critters spawned for.  At 90, people may not get credit to move forward.  Inductions only occur after official events.  Asking about membership in Discord may increase the likelihood of getting it.  The intent of this society was the most powerful of the powerful, and enabling a endgame style guild/whatnot like you see in other MMOs, but with a Gemstone spin.</p>

<p>That being said, while attendance is not mandatory on an x events/week basis, however, if we will sweep through the roster occasionally and remove people that are active and simply not participating.</p>

<p>So why attend?  Money, scrip, socializing, feeling a part of a community.  We're also planning on utilizing the MHO prize closets to reward individuals based on participation in the various events.  Since we're based on hunting, you know they'll be functional items to the maximum extent of what GMs will make us!</p>

<p>All of that being said, this is a catch-up post to bring myself up to speed on these forums, and introduce the Hand of the Arkati.  I will also be doing my best to post monthly updates on initiatives and what has been performed in the last month as a status update for all.  Although, looks like I already included the last months' numbers here.</p></div></article><article id="post-4439" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 10:02:35 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I never did an official write-up for July... so this will capture both July/August stuff.</p>

<p>The items outstanding from our June initiatives include:
-Clear Reim Fortress Defense
-One year Anniversary Celebration
-Roster Cleaning
-Roster Expansion</p>

<p>In July/August... Well, a couple things happened in my personal life that need to be addressed before we get into the initiatives results.  In July, I had a stroke, and spent a week in the hospital.  I blame all of you.  Supposedly fine, blessings from doctors and whatnot, but I can't really play Overwatch anymore.  Too many things to keep track of simultaneously, not quite there yet.  But, kept me away from the game to deploy on initiatives for a while.</p>

<p>In August, my wife had our second child, first daughter on the 15th.  Needless to say, my play time has been reduced ever since.  We have appointed additional leadership to help alleviate my absence.</p>

<p>Also in August, Duskruin happened!  Since Hand of the Arkati really is comprised of a lot of the most powerful people out there, many members were running Arenas 24/7... I know Kragdruk and Melivn had an arms race on who could do more arenas.  Durakar, Nuadjha, and many others also went crazy... you can see their posts over on the title testing thread.</p>

<p>All of that being said, we have inducted 7 new members in the last two months, with many more up and coming eligible for membership that we're planning on inducting as soon as we have a chance!</p>

<p>Also, August saw the results from the Craft bazaar!  We managed first place overall, with 57% of all sales in silver.  Below are the full stats:</p>

<p><strong>Hand of the Arkati Versus:</strong>
|                     | Items | Silver          |
|---------------------|-------|-----------------|
| ALL Other MHOs      | 503   |      6,418,092  |
| CHEs                | 3120  |    18,181,282   |

| HOA Percent         | 18%   | 57%             |</p>

<p>In short, we destroyed the Craft bazaar.  In doing so, we managed to max out an MHO's Endowment.  So... no more endowment contributions for a little while!</p>

<p>Lastly, which brings me to my initiatives for next month, we have gotten a reply from QC regarding our membership insignias...  The base materials are too rare.  After some escalation, backchannel communications, whatnot.  We decided... we don't want to change the materials of our insignias.  So instead, we're providing 1000 pounds of Rolaren and Eonake to facilitate the creation of insignias for our members.  We could just easily swap to vultite... but, we want what we want.</p>

<p>For September, our emphasis will remain on thoughtful roster growing and trimming, while working on this quest.  We are also tossing around ideas among leadership for a permanent structure, but super preliminary.  We just know that it can take a substantial amount of time to implement, and we want to have it ready as early as possible to submit the first possible second.</p></div></article><article id="post-4449" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 10:44:36 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>It's really cool to see this organization taking off and staying consistently active.
