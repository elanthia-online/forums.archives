<p>1650 is cool and all, and I'mma let you finish, but I just wanted to say that Monks have the best spell circle OF ALL TIME. </p>

<p>But it needs to be finished. It's not like we're missing our 50th level spell. We're missing three spells between level 7 and 25, and two of them are the flavor spells that made me want to play a Monk in the first place. </p>

<p>It's been yeeeaars here. It's not like waitin' on a Ranger guild or pushing to 50 ranks where I'd otherwise have stopped. We have to spend the TPs on these things for stuff we can't use because there's stuff after it we need also.</p></div></article><article id="post-1651" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">RJ</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 6:11:58 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@flimbo said in <a href="/post/1208">1200 Circle</a>:</p>

<p>Years ago it was the same for sorc's.

They're still spells we want and plan to implement, but they're not actively being worked at this moment.</p></div></article><article id="post-1992" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 1:50:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Yeah, that's how the company knows you want things to be developed. By asking frequently enough that they know there's an interest in you know...finishing something they released unfinished five years ago, which hopefully won't put too much of a dent in the time they spend developing new microtransaction systems. </p>

<p>If one person asks every couple years, it'll never get looked at. When enough people state that they want it, that's a way to show the company you would like that thing.</p>

<p>Actually, there's an idea. Maybe they could finish these spells, and then charge simucoins to unlock them. That might speed up the development process.</p>

<p>IMO the fact that you ask within the same 6 month period makes you more of a person they might ignore, like that guy who posts suggestions for things that already exist all of the time.</p></div></article><article id="post-2015" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 16th, 2017, 3:12:40 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli said in <a href="/post/2006">1200 Circle</a>:</p>

<p>I'm not the only person in this thread, and this thread didn't exist on these forums, which are more likely to get usage than the turn of the century official ones. </p>

<p>I'm not going to take crap from you for crossposting something that I feel is important to bring to the attention of the development team, nor should I. </p>

<p>Simutronics was way ahead of the curve in the releasing unfinished products game. That's the standard of the industry these days, "early access" and all, but asking for something to be finished more than once "within 6 months of a previous request" is not something that in dealings with any normal company would be cause for someone to be ignored. Especially not half a decade after the aforementioned release.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
