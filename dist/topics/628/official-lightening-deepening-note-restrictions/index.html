<p>This is the current list of denials: </p>

<p>Weight Reducing Containers
Morphing Containers
Dwarffest shield
SimpleBooks
Smuggling Sacks
Disarming Kits
Feature concealers (this is mostly for a specific version of a feature concealer that is pinworn)
WoundedWear
Eisenrucks</p>

<p>I also want to clarify something about the deepening note's functionality. If your item currently holds one item for a max of one pound (or ten pounds or fifteen pounds), then using a deepening note is only going to increase the poundage -- not the max items. In addition, things with tiny or very small capacity are ineligible, regardless of the script approval.</p>

<p>If a script has been denied to be used with a deepen note, it is also denied for use with lighten.</p>

<p>Omrii: Okay, thanks Haliste. You're way better than Wyrom.</p></div></article><article id="post-7059" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, October 30th, 2017, 6:43:26 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Quote from GM Haliste via Officials:</p>

<p>If a container is set to only hold 1 item or 2 items (for instance, a hat - or a pair of gloves - or any number of other things) then it's only ever going to hold what it was originally built as. The pound-limit will increase on deepens, but typically not the number of items. This is generally intended, since a hat is not meant to be storage in the same manner that a backpack is.</p>

<p>In addition, there are some items that also limit the max weight of items being placed inside a container. Light/deep notes do not affect that value, either - same with live merchants.</p>
