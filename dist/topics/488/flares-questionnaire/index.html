<p>I think flares on every hit with low damage output could also add legitimacy in some respects to under utilized weapons. Think of brawlers (not gloves or boots) or fast weapons with low damage output. Those weapons could be more competitive with flares because now they are flaring 2 times to one swing for slower weapons. Granted the slower weapons would still be the better overall choice but it could resurrect weapons that have long been pawn fodder.</p></div></article><article id="post-5127" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ashraam VanEyre</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 15th, 2017, 1:40:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Might be interesting to help weapon bases out if the flare chance was improved depending on the weapon's base speed or min RT.  Anything faster than say 5 seconds base speed, would get a modifier to improve the % chance to flare on the attack.</p>

<p>At 5s base weapon speed, the flare modifier is 12 times per minute for 25% chance to flare.
At 4s base weapon speed, the flare modifier is 15 times per minute for a 31.25% chance to flare (15/12 = 1.25 -- 1.25 x 25 = 31.25)
At 3s base weapon speed, the flare modifier is 20 times per minute for a 41.6% chance to flare (20/12  = 1.66 -- 1.66 x 25 = 41.6)
At 2s base weapon speed, the flare modifier is 30 times per minute for a 62.5% chance to flare (30/12 = 2.5 -- 2.5 x 25 = 62.5)
At 1s base weapon speed, the flare modifier is 60 times per minute for a 100% chance to flare</p>

<p>The above chart might be too powerful, but you could just change it to min RT, and then you'd cap out at 41.6% chance to flare (all weapons have a min RT of 3 seconds or greater when swung using ATTACK command).</p>

<p>This would only be compatible with non-UCS attacks as the UCS combat system is too fast to flare that often, and already benefits greatly from 25% chance flares.  But something like this would make swinging brawling weapons (i.e. cestus / knuckle-blades / hook knives) much more appealing while also improving whip-blades / daggers / and other faster but low damage weapons better for flaring.</p></div></article><article id="post-5165" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 16th, 2017, 2:00:56 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Wyrom Any chance of seeing rotflare type flare for other lores?

<p>that's a good idea, have lores tied to greater elemental flares to increase the strength (keep the base as is)</p></div></article><article id="post-5169" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">God</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 16th, 2017, 3:15:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I could go with possibly just general lores increasing flare chance, as flares should be useable by everyone and not just end up stealth buffing a few select classes.</p>

At the time, necromancy wasn't a very desirable lore for sorcerers either (before ensorcell).  Sorcerers and runestaves also haven't had a lot of love either when it comes to itemization.

<p>Creating another script similar to RotFlares would likely go through a more rigorous approval process.  I don't think we'd slap it on Greater Elemental Flares.  If we went down an elemental lore flare like RotFlares, it would be a whole new script that could work with other scripts.  But I'll be honest, if I were to code something like this, I'd probably go with some of the other lore types first before doing anything elemental.</p></div></article><article id="post-5197" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Soulance</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, September 17th, 2017, 7:27:55 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I do love the rotflares.

<p>This.  I purposedly stayed out of chances for rotflares because it didn't "fit", and in hope to catch future development that may work for gear improvement opportunity as a subscript.</p>

<p>And if @Wyrom is saying elemental is likely out, then maybe like using religion lore, that would enhance plasma or holy water (meh) flares for an anti rotflare type effect through subscript (and make it work with splitters! kthx)</p></div></article><article id="post-5208" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 18th, 2017, 12:08:14 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Honestly, when it comes to sub-scripted flares- I do worry about power creep if we start introducing too many of these.

<p>As long as flares of the same power as rot are kept as uber-expensive as rot, power creep might not be an issue. But to some degree that Elvis has already left the building with multiple DRs spinning out so many good items for dirt-cheap, ensorcelling added to the game, the new wps system everyone can use, and so on. I'd be surprised if this wasn't a topic at the top of the mind of the GMs.</p></div></article><article id="post-5211" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 18th, 2017, 1:12:02 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I don't want too many of these, I just want possible (in a non dark themed way).</p></div></article><article id="post-5213" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 18th, 2017, 6:31:04 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Vishra I don't think crit blessable will have that much of an impact when heavy weighting only gets 2 swings.

</blockquote>

<p>As someone who plays a Paladin, I'm really skeptical of this argument.    I've heard folks point this out, and to me it's just an argument of opportunity.  People aren't making it because they want to get back something Paladins lost (we didn't- we have the same functionality we had before).  They're making it because they feel like if they do, they might get something new out of the argument.</p>

<p>I don't find that particularly compelling.</p></div></article><article id="post-5261" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">OldSkool</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 20th, 2017, 9:34:37 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@god said in <a href="/post/5214">Flares Questionnaire</a>:</p>
