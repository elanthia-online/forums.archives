<p>I hope you all are enjoying your first few days of HARDCORE gameplay. To help celebrate the beginning of our competition, I have decided to create a contest to see who among our elite group of characters should be awarded the title of Best Dressed. </p>

<p>Who is Eligible - Everyone who has rolled up a HARDCORE character on or after November 1st, but on or before Friday November 10th is eligible to compete. </p>

<p>Deadline - The deadline for entry into the contest is 11:59pm EST 10 November.</p>

<p>How to Enter - To enter, simply post a screenshot of your character, to include your physical appearance, along with your current outfit. These posts can be on any message board you prefer: The Officials, The Elanthian Forums, or the PC. Simply reply to this thread (or a crossposted counterpart of it) to be eligible to compete.</p>

<p>The Rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>You must adhere to all HARDCORE stipulations when assembling your outfit. Nothing given to you by another character, or found outside of the confines of an NPC shop or while hunting is allowed.</li>
<li>You must source every single item in your outfit. This list should be placed AFTER your character's description. This is a critical rule, so failure to comply will result in your submission being disqualified. Examples of appropriate sourcing: </li>
</ol>

<p>Crystal Amulet - Starter item
Broadsword - Taken from a Kobold
Leather Boots - Bought from Suchandsuch Shop in the Landing</p>

<p>The Winner will be chosen by me as I am putting forth the silver. I will be more than happy to take feedback left by others in the thread into account. </p>

<p>Rewards:</p>

<p>The winner will be listed on the Leaderboards as "Best Dressed" for the 10 November Outfit Competition. The winner will also receive 1 million silvers to be given to a non-HARDCORE character of his or her choosing.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask questions related to this competition in replies to this thread.</p>

<p>GOOD LUCK YOU SEXY BEASTS!</p></div></article><article id="post-7234" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Hips</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, November 4th, 2017, 9:23:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This is amazing and I can't wait to see the entries.</p></div></article><article id="post-7377" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">OldSkool</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 9th, 2017, 8:57:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Guess I'll get the posts started!</p>
