<p>This.  I think festival of the fallen got up to three separate repost threads, and that's where it got a bit too much.  If we can start an official one per event, I'd very much appreciate.</p></div></article><article id="post-4828" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 9th, 2017, 1:13:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ArchSenex I just made this so I had it all contained in one post.

<p>Maybe the mods could pull things apart, and once things settle down set up the "official" threads and move the existing posts into each category.</p>
