<p>Fun with Fortress Furnishings</p>

<p>Have you ever looked around your house and just wanted to throw everything out? Well, now's your chance to design some furnishings for a home with a Vaalor theme. The types of furnishings include doors, storage containers, windows, beds, lighting, seating, wall hangings, and trash cans.</p>

<p>Here are the requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Submit a design for a furnishing and the type it follows (ie. a wyvern-carved door, doors).</li>
<li>Submit a second design for a furnishing and have the type be different than #1 submission.</li>
<li>Submit a third design for a furnishing and have the type be different than #1 and #2 (please do NOT 
submit 3 door designs. All designs should fall into different categories).</li>
<li>The furnishing design should fit a home found somewhere around the fortress of Ta'Vaalor.</li>
<li>The item may have either a long description OR a short description with a show and must follow ALTER rules.</li>
</ol>

<p>Entries that do not follow all five requirements will not be considered eligible. Contestants have until midnight PT on September 30, 2017 to get entries to me.</p>

<p>Ten winners will be chosen from the submitted entries. </p>

<p>Like all Premium Monthly Contests, entries are subject to change based on the discretion 
of the GMs and QC. Entries will be judged during the first week of October. Zoelle will not judge this contest except in the rare case of a tie. The winners will be announced as soon as possible afterwards. Zoelle reserves the right to make any changes to submissions that she, or QC, deems necessary. </p>

<p>Please direct any questions to the Premium Contests folder on the official message boards. </p>

<p>REMINDERS: THERE IS NO GUARANTEE ANY WINNING SUBMISSION WILL BE CREATED IN GAME! 
USE THE FORM IN PREMIUM 6 WHEN SENDING YOUR CONTEST ENTRY</p>
