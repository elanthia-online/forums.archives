<p>Edit to add:</p>

<p>Just checked the critical tables, and I was correct. Unbalance/grapple has a death crit threshold of rank 9 for most areas, when it can death crit. Most of the older ones, fire, lightning, et cetera, have rank between 6-7 depending on area to death crit.</p></div></article><article id="post-3655" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 1:40:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@lochiven said in <a href="/post/3651">Flare choice when you have enough weighting to supress guiding light</a>:</p>

<p>Yes, none of the property slots are tied to enchant.</p>

<p>You can theoretically, if approved, get a 10x enchant, 10x TD, or 10x DB, or 10X of weighting weapon or padding or resistance of each type etc for armor, with enchant.</p>

<p>Only zelnorn shares the bonus from enchant.  But I think he wasn't saying that but just that stancing down effectively does the same thing,</p></div></article><article id="post-3657" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 1:46:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The confusion might just be coming from the shorthand.  If Zelnorn is normally put as 3x/2x, then something that is 3x with 2x DB, under the hood, is probably 3x W/ 2x DB.  But for convenience, most people stack the bonuses into one syntax.</p>

<p>As for the initial question, I imagine like many things, it depends on what you're fighting.  But I find Plasma, Acid, and Disintegrate, to be good "all around" flares.  As Flimbo mentioned, Grapple/Unbalance are awesome, if you need them, but pointless if you don't.</p></div></article><article id="post-3658" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Lochiven</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 2:13:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@roblar,
Stancing down would provide the DS at the cost of AS.  If you can have 10x AS as well as 10x defender on the same item, why not have the best of both worlds.  That being said, defender was never one I'd even have considered in the past since weighting/flares was always more desirable but it is worth at least considering now being that it is an always on effect rather than the offensive boost from a flare 1/5 swings (I think that was the % chance to flare but don't quote me)</p>

<p>Before adding several weighting services, acid flares were what I had on my morning star.</p></div></article><article id="post-3659" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 2:23:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Yep, I was just saying I think that is what he was saying.  Defender would indeed be better than stancing for not losing AS, other than the slot being used for defense instead of offense which I'd prefer.</p>

<p>I'm all about the best of both worlds though!  So it is a better option than before but still not the best option in my opinion (maybe if you got it to +50, and/or are a squishier THW or non shield using type).</p></div></article><article id="post-3661" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Crime</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 28th, 2017, 2:41:59 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There's a 10x / 6x TD shield I know of...</p></div></article></div></body></html>
