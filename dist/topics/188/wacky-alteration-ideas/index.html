A fitted scarlet silk bodice embroidered with a golden eagle crest
A ruffled blue silk skirt dusted with white diamond stars
A wide golden girdle topped with a stylized eagle head
Some wide silver bracelets inlaid with ruby stars
Some knee high scarlet boots edged with white striping</p></div></article></div></body></html>
