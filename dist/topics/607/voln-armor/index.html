Same with IthzirArmor.  A lot of items are built in GS where the last unlock is where the real power comes into play.  But for these, the first unlock offers a lot more power than the base.</p>

<p>So can we get more unlocks?  Definitely.  It's just an approvals game.</p></div></article><article id="post-6869" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Erous</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, October 21st, 2017, 8:57:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If I had access to more Voln armor, I might consider going back to voln.

FoTF i lost all the raffles for it.  Hope this EG changes.  However, please don't take away from T1-T2 unlocks to add T0-T1, let us people who have had voln sitting around for so long get the opportunities to do so.  </p>

<p>Also, T0-T1 unlock is quite iffy imo because the base voln armor doesn't have any fusion/enhancives/padding/etc, it'll be quite obsoleteing all the voln armor that's been sold OTS if suddenly there's 10x HCP voln armor being created easily.</p></div></article><article id="post-6873" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 22nd, 2017, 3:09:33 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@darconas There's always heavy restrictions on what armors/weapons you can add mechanically enhancments too. HCP/HDP and +40 usually being the ceiling. The higher end Voln armors came from RTCF where the script was added to 10x armors w/padding and/or TD.</p>

<p>You also cannot put the voln script on fusion gear. You'll not see 10x HCP gear getting the script if they offered it.</p></div></article><article id="post-6874" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Erous</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 22nd, 2017, 11:16:25 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I personally haven't seen any fully unlocks, but used to have a 1 tier below fully full plate. For volners, the script is very powerful so I understand why unlocks are rare; however, it'd be nice, occasionally (once a year I dunno), to have the script added to a plain set.</p></div></article><article id="post-6875" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 22nd, 2017, 11:39:42 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I think they did at Festival of the Fallen.</p></div></article><article id="post-6876" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 22nd, 2017, 11:47:33 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>They did:</p>
