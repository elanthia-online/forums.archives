The one I know for sure is one is a deep blue scarab-clasped necklace sold at EG in 2004 or 2002. I can't find my notes on how to remove it, though, does anyone have any idea? I know it's not prod/tap/poke like the stun jewelry (already tried that). Rub makes it tighter and obviously trying to remove it will make it choke you until you die. Help!</p></div></article><article id="post-7805" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, December 11th, 2017, 4:07:26 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Neat item. Sorry that I don't have any idea how to remove them, but do let me know if you plan on putting the others on sale. I'd like to acquire at least one.</p></div></article><article id="post-7812" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">gsivkitt</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, December 11th, 2017, 8:41:55 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>With help from Dirvy, I got it figured out.  You have to let it kill you, then once you're back alive, you can remove it.  I've only found the one choking one so far, however I do have 7 of the stun jewelry pieces.  If you're interested in any of them, let me know.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
