I know that raising it casts Minor Elemental Edge. Anyone know if it's more special than that? Maybe wizard/merchant rechargeable? Maybe even self-charging?</p>

<p>It appears to have no zests.</p>

<p>@Wyrom help!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>look cube
  The words "I may contain the answers to life itself..." are clearly visible on one side of the cube, while "Or I may be a very sick joke..." can be seen on the opposite.  The only remaining words on the cube are "Limited Edition" with a small set of numbers stamped on it.
  There appears to be something written on it.

<p>```</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>read cub
  In the Common language, it reads:
  6 of 10
  ```</p>
</blockquote>

<p>```
raise cube
You raise your large iron cube skyward!
  1d100: 100 + Modifiers: 165 == 265</p>

<p>Your large iron cube glows brightly for a moment, but the glow becomes dull and fades.
Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.
