<p>Any chance we can get something similar to how the PC does it where we can see the sub-forums that have new posts?</p></div></article><article id="post-1583" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 2:15:56 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@durakar

<p>An 'easy' fix to the forum as a whole could be making such pages accessible by clicking on the main category heading or having a dropdown from the category button at the top.</p></div></article><article id="post-1615" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 3:39:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@durakar I think that went away with the recent update, pretty sure you could before.</p></div></article><article id="post-1628" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 4:43:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage </p>

<p>Let me try messing around with some settings live, in the system, in production.
