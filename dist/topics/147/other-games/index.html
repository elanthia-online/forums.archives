<p>Yeah, it originally had a ridiculous grind... they've nerfed it significantly every step of the way... If you bought it when it was still a paid sub based game, you end up with founder privileges and whatnot, which are nice.</p>

<p>Doesn't FFXIV have a sub?  I played FFXI until they increased the level caps.</p></div></article><article id="post-1376" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 11th, 2017, 10:39:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/1371">Other games??</a>:</p>

<p>Yeah, FFXIV Is one of the few that still manages a subscription model (you can buy mounts and cosmetic outfits as part of microtrans).  They've actually been growing, pretty cool given that the game was initially doomed.  I like XIV because it has a heavy narrative based approach, and I really need a good story in my games (something that GS frequently lacks, honestly).</p></div></article><article id="post-1434" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 9:57:24 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex said in <a href="/post/1376">Other games??</a>:</p>

<p>I hear you... I played FFXI for about 7 years or so, ridiculous grindfest, etc.  So, I can only hold FFXIV to the same caliber... but got so burned out when they raised the level cap and instantly started gear inflation AFTER 7 years that it was time to call it quits.  Did a stint back in WotLK and Cataclysm, and then came back to Gemstone full time.</p>

<p>Our TERA guild is Hand of the Arkati, as a btw.</p></div></article><article id="post-1706" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 8:32:29 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/1434">Other games??</a>:</p>
