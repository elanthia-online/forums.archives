Lesser undead bane is "the bane of all undead creatures <strong>that can be affected by it</strong>."</p>

<p>There's technically 4 different undead banes now, as there's also a lesser and greater version that only affects non-corporeal undead (as noted by "the bane of all <strong>non-corporeal</strong> undead creatures" in a loresong).  I don't recall if any of the NCU versions have gone out.</p></div></article><article id="post-7150" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, November 1st, 2017, 3:13:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What's the difference between greater and lesser?</p></div></article><article id="post-7152" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Estild</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, November 1st, 2017, 3:25:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>They're exactly the same, except the lesser undead bane still requires a bless/sanctification to affect the undead while the greater undead bane does not.</p></div></article><article id="post-7160" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, November 1st, 2017, 6:47:30 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Anyone have the loresong message for greater undead bane so I can update the wiki?</p></div></article><article id="post-7170" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 2nd, 2017, 12:08:57 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@estild so greater undead bane is just " the bane of all undead creatures."?</p>

<p>Also does the greater non-corporeal version still have a permabless effect for all undead?  Or is it only the extra AS, flare, or weighting that affect them but it is still effectively permablessed?</p>

<p>and thanks for the initial response.</p></div></article><article id="post-7171" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 2nd, 2017, 12:25:02 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Estild Also, I had my greater undead bane sung and I don't remember the line below being part of an earlier bardsong or if the song is confusing a true sanctified item (mine isn't) with Undead Bane?</p>

<p>"The harmonics generated tell you that the waraxe inflicts more fearsome wounds when it strikes and <strong>has been sanctified for use by a Cleric or Paladin in the fight against the undead.</strong>"</p></div></article><article id="post-7192" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Aluvius</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 2nd, 2017, 8:57:05 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@roblar Check your info ... you are a paladin now, pray they don't alter the deal further.</p></div></article><article id="post-7193" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 2nd, 2017, 9:12:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/1BXa2alBjrCXC/giphy.gif" alt="alt text" title="" /></p></div></article><article id="post-7197" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, November 3rd, 2017, 10:31:24 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@estild said in <a href="/post/7152">Undead Bane</a>:</p>

  <p>They're exactly the same, except the lesser undead bane still requires a bless/sanctification to affect the undead while the greater undead bane does not.</p>

<p>This is like saying a porche and a pinto are the same thing, because they both have 4 wheels.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
