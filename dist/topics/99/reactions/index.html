<p>Did not notice the downvote feature, and assumed it was left out for reasons of general positivity. In either case, picture this... troll thread begins... replies come in, food for the troll is offered, troll gets what they want... scenario two... troll rides in on horse, makes inflammatory post, gets 500 angry-face reactions and zero replies.

<p>Yeah, the Stack system would work really well for Q&amp;A, but not so much for discussion. A Q&amp;A section following Stack-like mechanics (FOR mechanics questions??) would be pretty awesome, and would allow the real goods to float right to the top. Just like Stack.</p>

<p>Agree that downvoting could lead to unnecessary negativity. But also that reactions in general (even a calculator 'reaction' as suggested by @Cervantes would be cool) would be pretty awesome, so long as the total number of potential reactions is limited to 5-7. </p>

<p>This could add a valuable dimension to both UX, and available data, and there's no such thing as too much data.</p></div></article><article id="post-672" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">peam</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 4:35:57 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The ^ system is perfect.</p></div></article><article id="post-674" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 4:37:23 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@peam said in <a href="/post/672">Reactions</a>:</p>

<p>1)  Please abide by the TOS like I have sworn to do.  There's no need to be all judgmental towards other people, especially since I have been nothing but respectful and kind since I arrived.
2) Calling someone a troll when they are doing nothing is hurtful.  Please stop.
3) I do play GS and have been for quite some time.  Don't just assume.. because you know what that means.
4) I'm going to upvote you in the hopes that that little reward will help you get over all your preconceived notions towards me.. given you never posted on the other website.</p>

<p>I do hope you are not referring to my posts.  I've done nothing at all on this forum to warrant this type of harassment.  I don't even know who you are!</p>

<p>This weekend (hopefully) they will have ignore poster enabled and you can just ignore me, though I'm not sure why.</p>
