<p>A crimson liveried messenger marches in. With crisp, precise movements, he unfurls a scroll and announces:</p>

<p>Raffle tables have been set up throughout the lands in hopes of finding worthy combatants for the upcoming Festival of the Fallen to be held outside the elven city-state of Ta'Vaalor. Each table will randomly select five combatants. The tables have been placed in areas that require FULL citizenship in the realm they represent to access. If a municipality does not provide the full five combatants, more will be chosen through a second, unrestricted, drawing in Ta'Vaalor. Good luck to all who enter. The locations for the entry tables are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teras Isle: The Hog's Pen, Citizens Lounge</li>
<li>Rivers Rest: A Derelict Hovel</li>
<li>Solhaven: A Derelict Hovel</li>
<li>Icemule Trace: Thirsty Penguin, Game Room</li>
<li>Whenimer's Landing: Moot Hall, Orchard</li>
<li>Cysaegir: Cysaegir, West Niche</li>
<li>Ta'Illistim: Ta'Illistim, Tower of Shadows</li>
<li>Ta'Vaalor: Guardian Keep, Chamber</li>
<li>Mist Harbor: West Guardtower, Interior</li>
<li>Zul Logoth: A Derelict Hovel</li>
</ul>

<p>Criers cried, hucksters hucked, and champions for this year's Festival of the Fallen combat trials were chosen. Representing...</p>

<p>Ta'Vaalor:
Kakoon
Pereus</p>

<p>Ice Mule Trace:
Roblar
Burgoczorn</p>

<p>Whenimer's Landing:
Zalion
Leafiara
Aureliano</p>

<p>No other city-states, principalities, kingdoms, or islands put forth a Champion. To fill remaining bracket locations, a raffle will be set out within the Festival of the Fallen grounds on opening night and will draw Saturday morning. All entrants chosen at this drawing will not be considered Champions of any such town but merely eager participants of the arena.</p>

<p>We will place the raffle when the festival opens on Thursday and have it draw Thursday night (this gives us plenty of time to make the brackets). I realize several people forgot about the raffle (were entered but not logged in when it drew), if I retroactively give titles to one, I have to do it for all and that's not something that I can verify easily so no retroactive titles will be granted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, I was told the drawing for the champs happened on Thursday night, not Saturday as mentioned in the announcement. Will you be holding another raffle on Saturday morning?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely my fault. I set the raffle up early to help gauge interest levels and there was a glitch in the time. Unfortunately, I didn't catch it until people had entered and it was too late. Instead of doing another raffle, we will take entrants for the remaining spots at the bonfire, one hour before the tournament starts on Sunday. If we have more interest than spots, we will spin for the spots. Again, I apologize for the mishap.</p>
