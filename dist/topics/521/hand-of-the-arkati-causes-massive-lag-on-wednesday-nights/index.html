<p>Hand of the Arkati farms Reim every Wednesday night.  "Farming" Reim means that unlike a normal Reim progression, we're just hanging out in the plaza for 2 hours from 8:30 to 10:30 PM.  Being in the first area allows people the ability to invest in simucoin Reim entries, and re-orb their progress.  If you burn a simucoin entry while in the midst of a run, it will reset your scrip progress.  On a typical farming night, most individuals can reorb up to 10 times, for 10k scrip.  Since many of us are going for Ethereal armor, Adding ethereal armor on armor and fully unlocking it requires 2,280,000 scrip.  Doing this once a week boosts weekly gains from 7k scrip up to 18k scrip.  Meaning we can complete in 2.4 years instead of 6.2 years.</p>

<p>There are proportionate spawns to the participants in Reim.  Having more people means more per wave, means more script per wave, means faster scrip gain per person, means more silvers (but more splits... kind of nets out).  We are not spam-attacking.  With >25 people, each person can usually only attack once per wave for the tag, credit, etc.  We really just want scrip as fast as possible.  The timetables are intense, and we want our shiney armor!  People come and go, burn their Long Term boosts, their instant absorbers, refill favor, gather their necro energy, etc.  It's our little service night... except... in Reim, killing creatures.</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out that our recent Wednesday farming nights are far from the maximum quantity of people we've had in Reim with us.  We've reached up to 32 people running Reim, without falter, without lag.  I have detailed information about how many people have run any event with HoA since our first run on 7/19/2016, and over 280 events since then.  We have been running Wednesday farm nights officially on the calendar since 5/20/2017.  It's a great display that combat, and the systems that use to support Gemstone are becoming more complex as times go on.  While it's obvious when we see lag with >700 people when we used to see lag with only >2500 people, it's because every attack is now not just evaluating a weapon for enchant, weighting, flares, but also now confirming your enhanced stat, looking for a variety of script flares, evaluating ensorcelling potential, potentially checking both weightings, etc, etc.  Everything across Gemstone has gotten infinitely more complex since yesteryears.  Complex for the better.  But realistically, outside of early Dreavenings, there really wasn't an organization such as this to really stress the servers.  So, every &lt;.1% processing speed loss over the last 20 years may have added up!  All that said, I admit this is mostly speculation on anecdotal observation.</p>

<p>We are doing our best to attempt the various built-in mechanisms for lag reduction.  Wyrom stated in Discord that the lag was predominantly generated by third-party messaging.  That doesn't mean Lich, that's more about Whirlin casts 518, and then the other 27 people get a bunch of scroll with his 99999 AS attacks against 52 different critters.  That transmission to the 27 other people was more strain than the calculation/execution of the attack.  To help remediate this, we tested out the combatbrief flag yesterday, and observed a decrease in the quantity of XML that was being transmitted to our clients.  That being said, the xml packets still contained critical flavor text, which while was not prompted on the UI, was incredibly prevalent in the logs being sent by the simu Servers.  Unfortunately, combatbrief alone (for at least a dozen of the 28 people) was insufficient to curb the lag.  We discussed Lost Ranger's ;briefcombat script, but it's really a post-transmission filtering process, and would not reduce the Simu Server load.</p>

<p>Changing the date does not address any of these underlying concerns.  There is a structural concern with how groups of this size are managed.  We are looking to further expand the HoA roster, and Wyrom has stated that end-game content is on the horizon, probably even before Savants (yes, that was a joke).  Changing the date isn't kicking the can down the road, it's moving a mattress from the middle lane of the highway to a different lane of the highway rather than having it removed.  It's still going to cause an issue until the mattress is removed.  While also impacting every single one of our members and guests that have scheduled Wednesday nights with us to gather their Favor, their Necro-Energy, burn their Long Term boosts, their Instant-clearers, their Reim Orbs.  We have a roster of 78 with probably about 2 dozen rotating guests to consider.  We are willing to work with the GMs on stop gaps, and sit down with further discussions about things we'd like to see from capped hunting, etc... but swapping the dates does not address anything that caused it to be a problem in the first place. </p>

<p>Don't misunderstand, we want this lag gone too.  I know of at least 3 people that would join our ranks if our events were more feasible to execute.  But with the lag introduced, they were having more difficulty hitting the rares, and progressing through Reim, and they didn't feel welcome because of their 286 computer with their 14.4 modem not being able to keep up.</p>

<p>Wyrom stepped in last night on Discord and said that he will be making it a priority to speak with Rester and some on-site people regarding options.  We welcome anything short term such as capping out spawns in Reim based on X people, but would request script per kill increased proportionately as to not directly/exclusively nerf us.  This is likely easier/faster to do than an overhaul of the combatbrief command.  And once that overhaul does go live, I will work with our members to ensure that they are running the commands to reduce system utilization and streamline the game for all players.  We just need time to get there.</p></div></article><article id="post-5500" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 9:47:42 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Alternatively, with all the simucoin sales they could invest money and time into not making the core of the game shit?</p></div></article><article id="post-5501" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 9:55:08 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Being as how (and yes, I realize use of that phrase earns me a minimum of three 'douche' points) White Haven's service night seems to line up directly with HoA farming night, I'm glad to see that there's some thought being put into alleviating the lag issues.</p>

<p>That said, I definitely understand that it's a mattress in the highway situation.  While I PERSONALLY would prefer that it not be Wednesday nights, I understand that it has to be sometime, and if it were to be rescheduled it'd just be inconveniencing someone else.</p>

<p>Toes crossed that Wyrom and company can come up with some sort of alternative.

<p>Apparently @Whirlin forgot to post some of his responses from the officials, but he addressed that issue there. I'll cross-post here:
It defeats the purpose, as outlined above. More people, more tags per time, more rewards, more XP, more fame, more favor, more everything. Breaking the group into smaller groups not only fragments our participation, could causes clicks for people that want to be in close proximity to other members, forks any pre-made reorbing scripts already set to return to the plaza (off the beaten path, per request by Retser), introduces an additional unsafe rooms in the Reim area for soloers, etc. It's overall a lose-lose-lose, it defeats the purpose of a single, cohesive MHO, it reduces individual benefits, and potentially introduces more drama. Additionally, it does not address any underlying system concern that are causing the problems in the first place.</p></div></article><article id="post-5507" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 10:46:52 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@horibu said in <a href="/post/5506">Hand of the Arkati causes massive lag on Wednesday Nights</a>:</p>

  <p>Hyperbole aside, is it 709 that is causing a lot of the issues?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have crashed Reim due to 709.  The first time creatures got lumped into a "And many other things" messaging, because we had 3 sorcerers all using 709, caused a wrapping effect, etc.  This was why invasions got disabled. </p>

<p>Wrapping effect... You know when there are a shit ton of objects in a room, and you look, and you see "And many other objects"... that's what I meant.</p>

<p>Given that messaging/etc is a concern and lag inducer, arms have their own periodic ambients/attacks/etc that each need to be pushed, as well as decaying, and not a single one per user.  Given that ambients do have the ability to cause lag, these are absolutely hurting more than a 512/518/912/410/1030/635/1630/135 tag</p></div></article><article id="post-5514" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">horibu</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 11:22:37 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There should flat out be some sort of squelching mechanic built into the game as we get this issue in more than just Reim.

<p>We're not going to split our nightly group hunts up, as that hurts our gains within Reim for reasons mentioned above. Is it selfish, yes, but we pay just as much as everyone else to play the game. Everyone should be able to play the game how they want within the rules/guidelines Simu lays out before us. Does this cause issue for others, yes. But so does everyone going to a dreavening, logging in their alts for raffles, running MA groups in hunting grounds. Should we tell them all to stop as well until Simu beefs up the server or does a better client/server messaging system, definitely not. We just adapt our play style to accommodate. We could move "Farm" night to another night but we'd still gather at 8:30pm to do a Reim run on Wednesday regardless for a regular run then. Unless someone can make Simu just give us flat out silvers/script/fame/exp for not running on Guild night, which you'd have a better chance of getting Savants implemented instead.</p></div></article><article id="post-5515" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 11:26:22 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If the user numbers are going up these problems are going to happen more and more as the game caters to power gamers and mechanics min/maxing.

<p>Yep, and we've worked with the GMs on it.  We're attacked as often as we attack.  People coming in on us, us walking in on people, and some instancing anomalies in the throne room.  We've established additional rules and guidance on timetables of farming and progression, announcing our events, etc, and run them publicly, welcoming all people.  If people decide not to run with us, they can't claim that they were not aware we were in there.  We've worked with other groups and GMs on establishing where in each part of the castle we will be as to ensure that we're not standing in a bottleneck location that people need to pass, and we've identified a few areas were more rooms off the beaten path would be ideal (road).</p></div></article><article id="post-5523" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">BriarFox</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 11:56:08 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>We're very responsive and inclusive.

<p>The end is when you've run out of orbs or reached your ghost bucks goals.

It cant be exp because you can only absorb so much for so long, even if you built up a reserve of LTEs its at the expense of not using them elsewear, same with instant absorbs and other methods. The treasure is trash and should hit a hard cap on how many people in a group actually scales the loot table anyway, and it can easily be pooled between groups and split evenly amongst everyone. 
It really just comes down to ghost bucks and how long it takes to accumulate them, which you are already self-regulating to 2 hours. 
How much are you impacting yourselves in the short term with generation? Its just as much in your own best interests as it is everyone else's to remove the lag as quickly as possible.</p></div></article><article id="post-5539" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 12:43:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Not everyone re-orbs.

Wyrom said he and on-site people and Retser were going to look into it today, hopefully they can figure out a fix quickly.  Whatever changes recently happened that started the lag (because we all can see the calendar, they've been doing this for ages and it's only been a problem in the past few weeks) can maybe be tweaked.</p>

<p>Making this adversarial is ignoring that the problem isn't HOA, it's something recent and on the server-end.  We can all get out our pitchforks and torches and slam them, but discouraging large group activities in the game isn't really feasible and completely removing that aspect cuts out a chunk of the player base that loves big group events. I'm nowhere near capping, but I (like I'm sure many other GS players) have played other games and that comraderie that big end-game groups bring is something I miss, and something that has long been missing from Gemstone.  I'm happy to see HOA filling that niche.</p>

<p>That said, if it doesn't get fixed quickly, shifting it off of guild night (or perhaps petitioning for guild night to be moved) would be appreciated by many.  Saying that moving it will piss off someone doesn't really address that guild night is a BIG DEAL for a good number of players <em>every</em> week.

<p>This is a recent problem that's cropped up.  The GMs are working on it.  Nobody should have to change their play style (so long as it's within policy) to accommodate anyone else.

<p>Since they are running long-term scripts and creating heavy scroll during this time, it might be considered against policy since it is causing scroll that is interfering with other's enjoyment.  <strong>I don't think HoA should be taken to task on Policy</strong>, but it is there.</p>

<p>Whirlin cited the scripts as a reason to not break up the group. You are getting 40+ creatures because of the size of the group.

<p>Then 709 would be identical to 410 which sorcerers already get so what's the point.  The nice thing about 709 is the additional knockdowns and pins downs.

  <p>Then 709 would be identical to 410 which sorcerers already get so what's the point.  The nice thing about 709 is the additional knockdowns and pins downs.  I'm sure there would be a way to code it without making additional room items, but nerfing what makes it unique is not the way.</p>

<p>Yes, but I can cast 709 twice in a swarm when hunting alone and it doesn't cause any noticeable lag for everyone else playing.

We've been running Reim on a nightly basis for over 10 months.  Tuesdays and Wednesdays end up being more popular dates, with or without an official calendar'ed event, averagiong between 15 and 18 participants since we started keeping track on 7/19/2016.  Since then we've added rigor to our communication so people are aware of when we're entering, we've been more concrete on timetables on entry, more specific on timetables for progression, more specific on how quickly we progress.  Based on unforseen interactions with players, we've established scripts to hold people's hands at a script-pace to reduce the likelihood that a straggler could walk into AoEs, we've established specific areas that we'll stand when working on progression so that we're not standing in the potential way of another Reimer, and scripts have been created to help ensure that people that are cleared already will not explode a critter before people that are not cleared need it.  And we made the scripts readily available to the player base, outside of HoA.</p>

<p>When lag was brought up yesterday, we communicated intentions on our discord server, and began testing the combat brief flag to alleviate lag, captured XML logs, and shared them with the GMs to help trouble shoot potential solutions.  I'd say at least half the people initiated combatbrief on simultaneously to help reduce lag (of those that verbally verified)</p>

<p>I've gone through restructuring guilds, trying to break a 25 man raid group into two 10 mans.  It does not end well.  First and foremost, this would ONLY address concerns over farming night.  For the reasons for the lag outlined, there is nothing isolated about farming night that would cause more/less lag than a progression night.  So whether we're farming/progressing/etc, the same concerns would be noted.  Therefore splitting the group into two becomes unfeasible due to a single path to progress to the next area, and potential for overlap on eachother's feet.  Additionally, trying to objectively divide up 25 people when it comes to interpersonal conflict, individual power, responsiveness, etc, is not an easy feat.  Having seen the shortcomings in attempting to do something in the past unsuccessfully, it's not something that I want to do again in seeing all of the additional drama and management associated with it.  If you've done it, it's not something you'd wish upon anyone.</p>

<p>It's also a relatively new thing that it has become a problem, which is causing us to scratch our heads.  We've had incredibly successful, minimal lag runs with up to 31 participants multiple times.  28 people causing ridiculously systemic lag does not reconcile with our own datapoints.  Something must have changed to reduce this threshold by 10%.  We thought we had more time before we were consistently causing a problem on Simu's side... and honestly, so did they.  This is not an unknown issue to them, it simply hasn't been the top priority.  Considering that yesterday there was an uproar about giftbox item delivery... they're getting pulled in a billion directions.  Especially on the eve of Ebon Gate... think of all the additional work they're already trying to do!</p>

<p>We're doing everything we can to support players, support the GMs, support the community, and keep people informed about our actions.  I don't think it's unreasonable to state that we don't also restructure our event structure, redesign the calendar that we spent longer than I want to admit planning (even with planning, there was still an ungodly amount of drama), and ask people to change more aspects of their lives.  Gemstone has a need for this niche style of MHO dedicated to hunting.  That's why we've had the turnout that we've had, and that's why I want to expand upon it.  Yes, changes must be made to facilitate something like this, because we've never had anything quite like it in the past, but it's good for the environment to have the options.  Yes, there are growing pains that we're working through, just like we did with other people in Reim before, but we'll continue doing things are reasonable without jeopardizing things that we've been worked for.</p></div></article><article id="post-5572" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 3:02:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@flimbo said in <a href="/post/5570">Hand of the Arkati causes massive lag on Wednesday Nights</a>:</p>

<p>While true, splintering off the Mstrikers would then negatively impact the casters with the proper AoEs that the monks don't have.  Additionally, there's an assumption that the same quantity of critters will be in the room by the time your mstrike is calculated, and wasn't already previously killed.  Having the higher critters in the room will increase the likelihood that you're FULL mstrike goes off.</p>

<p>Also, monks are absolutely amazing in Reim, and in groups, and are one of my favorites.</p></div></article><article id="post-5573" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 3:03:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/5572">Hand of the Arkati causes massive lag on Wednesday Nights</a>:</p>

<p>We tried having a no orb stance when the changes to the looting pressure, and trading effects went live and hurt us substantially.  I really wasn't able to properly enforce it.  We currently have 62 premium account members, with potentially more alts, and/or buying orbs.  There's a lot.

<p>The problem isn't the use of the spell, the problem is the design of the spell.  If the spell were designed correctly, it wouldn't create the issue.</p></div></article><article id="post-5585" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 4:06:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Interesting discussion.</p>

<p>As to 709:
I like the design of the spell, simply because I enjoy the fact that literal arms and stuff pop out of the ground. It looks cool.</p>

<p>Which is important. The spell FEELS different than 410, even if there is not much mechanical difference really. But in design, FEELING different is far more important than actually being different.</p>

<p>As to the HOA/LAG/ETC:
Mandatory Plug: Sounds like a prime problem! Plat dont got that BS :) </p>

<p>Seriously though. Looks like theres a lot of contributers here to what is happening. Would simply NOT scripting and only manually inputting your commands help the issue? I honestly do not know. Someone on the Officials mentioned that might be the case but...as I said, I dont know programming.</p>

<p>But if one of the groups causing issues can quickly fix said issues until SIMU gets things right on their end? And they wont because they will get less ghostbucks for the month or three these fixes will take? I'm just sayin...if simply manually inputting commands wont fix things...and guild night people cant really be the ones to move to another night here...maybe you should think about doing something that'll help the majority?</p>

<p>As I said. I dont care. I dont play prime really.

<p>I don't think asking to split these groups up or, at the very least, run them on a different night is too much to ask.

There is definitely a compromise to be had here, hopefully the officership of HoA will be willing to work not only with the GMs on a long-term fix, but with the community on a more quickly-implemented, short term one.</p></div></article><article id="post-5595" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ragz</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 4:48:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What a ridiculous point of view that you would place the entire fault of the broken back on a single straw, as you so eloquently put it lol.

<p>I'm just following the official standpoint of Wyrom on the officials - The HoA combined with guild night is too much for the server. Are there other factors? I'm there are. We are discussing the one factor that we know is 100% within player control - The massive group HoA hunt during guild night, the exact combination that is causing the problem. </p>

<p>If i was in control of one of the factors leading to the cause of the issues, yes I would make a change to reduce or remove that issue. Doubly so if I could find another way to accomplish the same thing I was doing before without impacting other people negatively. I don't really see why its such a hard decision to make, unless you really just don't believe any of that BS about helping the community and the game as a whole because it impacts your bottom line. If massive group hunts in Reim DIDN'T cause lag, we wouldn't even be having this conversation at all.</p></div></article><article id="post-5597" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 4:56:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>So theres an Ancient Legend I just made up...theres a highway.

<p>I'll crosspost this from the officials, bc it responds to this nicely:</p>

<p>the difference, unless I'm mistaken, is that on Wednesdays they stay in one room, building up a pile of junk/treasure, with more people than other nights, and on other nights they progress through the quest in a more timely fashion and don't build up the same number of items on the ground.</p>

<p>please correct me and I apologize if I am wrong. Here are the relevant parts of the event descriptions from the calendar:</p>

<p>Capped Reim Farming (Wed):</p>

  <p>This run will not focus on progression, but will enable participants to stay in the first area, and burn as many charges of Reim orbs as they want! Gather up that Ethereal Scrip!</p>

<p>Nah, I get it... people just seem to constantly be ignoring the fact that we've been running every day to 10 months, and yes, it's been a problem the past two weeks, and we're working on fixing it.

<p>By your own admission Wedenesday night runs are different than daily runs.  Every other day you do full progression.  On Wednesday night's you camp 1 room with a lot of people (which you admit you picked that night to maximize participation) and spawn wave after wave.  Don't change the facts to fit your argument.

<p>Nothing is piled up, looting is happening consistently along with searching, just like progression night, the room is fully clear before the next wave spawns 82 seconds later.  Everything is sacked, and sacks given to participants until we're ready to sell at the end, just like a progression night.</p>

<p>So I am ~<em>~</em>~LITERALLY~<em>~</em>~ having this exact same discussion in work in weekly meetings. </p>

<p>Hardware - "Your shit software is slow, fix it. We do the same thing every day in and day out and it's gotten worse!"
software - "well, you see we have some hard numbers here on the amount of users etc and it turns out that the number of users went up by 5% before the slowness hit"
back and forth and turns out that welp the software is shit and thats the number of users where our SQL backend shits itself. </p>

<p>How does that tie in to this whole conversation? Sure, you've done the same thing, and you have the numbers of people participating. As Wyrom likes to trot out, there are more subscriptions, more people playing, everyone sees the number of logged in users going up. It's been pointed out its a combination of your event + guilds/guild night causing the problem. It might be because there is a 5% increase in the amount of people doing guild work, even with your numbers going down slightly. Either way, its gotten to the point it impacts everyone else. People are busting your balls because 
A) You can potentially make a quick meaningful change that might help ease the issue while it (hopefully) is being worked on in the background
B) Instead of approaching it from a standpoint of helping others, immediately circled the wagons, attacked other people for "How you play the game" and all other manner of "fuck you got mine" responses which won you few if any fans.</p></div></article><article id="post-5609" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 5:14:50 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Our membership and participation increase over time since inception has been 0.02 people per day.

<p>Well fortunately this can all be handled with Science. <br />
Hypothesis:  HoA Wednesday night runs are correlated to high lag on Wednesday night's.</p>

<p>Methodology: Observe lag on a Wednesday night when HoA does a Reim run and a Wednesday night when they do not.  </p>

<p>There it's testable and only requires your group to forgoe one farming session.  If there is no change you can tell us all to go Fuck ourselves (though many in your group already have).  If there is a change then you'd have to recognize the correlation.

<p>A lot of crappy things we have to do are because we live in a community.  I personally hate mowing the lawn but my neighbors prefer that I do it (And I live in Florida so that's a year round obligation).  So I mow my friggin yard every week (I get away with 2 weeks in the "winter") not because I give a shit about it but because my neighbors shouldn't have to live with my selfish choices.  Sure I could hire someone to do it for me, but I'm cheap so I don't.  Since all my choices are crappy I picked the least crappy one.  I also pay taxes, use turn signals, and a bunch of other things I wouldn't do if I was the only person in the world.</p></div></article><article id="post-5616" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ragz</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 5:33:30 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This kind of science is akin to B.O.B. invoking physics to deny the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>What can we, the Non HoA player base control that contributes significantly to the lag without interfering with normal game play?  Can we control what night is guild night? And even if we could the same you picked Wednesday night to farm Reim is probably the same reason why Wednesday is guild night?</p>

<p>Obviously we can't fix Simu coding issues or server issues.</p>

<p>What else is left?  Service nights?  Dreavenings?  Do you think that your Reim farming should come before those services?  Especially since both predate your May 2017 farming nights?  </p>

    <p>Short of paying cash (lol) to get another guild night form, there isn't much, if anything, that can be done from a player's standpoint on guild night. You have a group of people who only share "doing random unconnected guild work" as their connector verses a group who are part of the same MHO doing the same thing as part of their focused event. Which of those two, as a player, has a better chance of being altered with any realistic chance of success?</p>
    
    <p>You know what would be interesting, player-specific guild night options. You pick when you get your 8/7/6 whatever hours of double benefits. Let players form up times throughout the week to come together.</p>

  <p>Or just splitting guild nights, a few classes per night.</p>

<p>Given that the buff for guild nights is once a week, during a set time... you're asking to have multiple guild nights run for specific guilds... which requires more coding and setup. That's OK, but splitting up your REIM farm group is insulting to you? The mind boggles.</p></div></article><article id="post-5627" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 6:08:09 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>http://forums.play.net/forums/GemStone%20IV/Paid%20Events:%20Adventures,%20Quests,%20and%20SimuCoins/The%20Settlement%20of%20Reim/view/913</p>

If you remove one, doesn't matter which, the odds of no lag happening is going to happen. The issue comes down to EVERYONE wanting to have enjoyment at the same time the way each person wants to have that enjoyment. It's not possible in the current state of the game server to be able to make EVERYONE happy. If we the players come up with a solution one side is going to lose the enjoyment they would want or expect. Is that fair, no, will it make people pissed off at each other, more than likely yes.</p>

<p>The only real solution should be Simutronics instead of us as a playerbase trying to hash it all out. Whether that is Simu converting normal Reim into limited group sizes, capping monster spawns, moving guild night, making guild night personal ala Lumnis, improving server performance, whatever. As has been said though, Wyrom is discussing it. Hopefully he'll post what he was able to brainstorm with the other GMs soon so we can work towards whatever solution is proposed.</p>

<p>And as I'm posting this it looks like Simu finally decided on a temp fix of capping creatures per spawn. So we'll see how that goes. Can't wait to see what that is.</p></div></article><article id="post-5629" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Zombiesdontrun</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 6:10:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>As for service nights and Dreavenings your group could work with them to lessen the impact.</p>

<p>Dealt with it temporarily you mean, as they only capped the amount of REIM spawns per room for the meantime to cut down on the lag, presumably until they have a better idea of what exactly is driving the lag on both the REIM side and Guild night side.</p></div></article><article id="post-5640" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 7:37:11 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@viekn My vote would be a 25 year old game engine.</p></div></article><article id="post-5641" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Durakar</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 7:57:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Is it time for Gemstone V: Wrath of Kenstrom?</p></div></article><article id="post-5642" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ponclast</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 8:01:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I bet the problem is O(n^2) and even O(n^3) growth. If you have n players in a room doing guild reps constantly, that results in n^2 events being sent by the server for each unit of time. Even worse, if you have n players and n mobs in a room, and all the players are constantly AOEing, you have n^3 events for each unit of time. (For example: 5 players, 5 mobs. Each player AOEs, generating 25 total mob hits. Each hit is in turn sent to all 5 players, resulting in 150 events. Not too bad... but with 30 players and 30 mobs, it's 27000 events.

<p>I'd even go farther for this and do each city and surrounding hunting in its own virtual server, pairing up some of the ones that see less people around it.  And then put festivals into their own virtual server as well.  Limit where the issues occur and it can even help in tracking down and hopefully resolving those at some point.</p>

Reim isn't a true "instance" as many people think of an instance in gaming terminology. The different levels of Reim are just the exact same rooms copy/pasted 4 times and each one set to spawn specific ranges of critters.
If they could TRUELY instance the game on different servers etc, then yes that would probably cut down on a lot. Given the limited number of people and the costs involved in that, I wouldn't ever expect that to happen.</p></div></article><article id="post-5645" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, September 28th, 2017, 8:52:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@briarfox said in <a href="/post/5523">Hand of the Arkati causes massive lag on Wednesday Nights</a>:</p>

<p>I would hesitate to re-schedule White Haven's service night again, as we did so fairly recently (from Thursdays to Wednesdays). It sounds like things are going to calm down a bit due to Ebon gate, and Retser has already posted on the officials that he has capped the max number of spawns per room. So I'm confident the situation will be resolved soon. If we're still experiencing issues in November, I'll sit down with the officers to discuss another re-schedule.</p></div></article><article id="post-5662" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 29th, 2017, 12:42:05 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Holy crap, this thread blew up.</p>

<p>no one suggested that. people suggested that, as they were identified as a cause of the lag, and since they have more control over their schedule than those who wish to do  guild night, that they should take action to alleviate the pressure on game system until Simu could address hardware issues.</p></div></article><article id="post-5669" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 29th, 2017, 1:04:39 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>After getting several messages last night saying I should pay attention to this topic I spent the morning reading it.</p>

Instead of coming together, waiting for the Official Response, and if it was not strong enough standing united with each other and saying, "Hey Simu if you want to increasingly keep cashing in our community, you had better reinvest in it."  everyone drew lines in the sand and divided the player base and now people have probably worsened impressions of each other. </p>
