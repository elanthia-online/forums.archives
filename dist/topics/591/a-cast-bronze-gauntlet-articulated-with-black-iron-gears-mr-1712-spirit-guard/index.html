<p>You sense a faint aura of magic surrounding the gauntlet.  You also feel a faint drawing sensation from it, as though when its charge is depleted, it may be refilled.  From the pitch of the vibration you determine that the purpose of the gauntlet is as a wearable container of some kind with a maximum interior capacity of two pounds with room for up to two items, where each item can weigh up to 2 pounds.</p>

<p>The cast bronze gauntlet contains the spell Spirit Guard, from the Arcane circle.
You sense that the cast bronze gauntlet will persist after its last magical charge has been expended.</p>

<p>Taking reasonable offers</p></div></article><article id="post-6619" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">amerek</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 15th, 2017, 9:40:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Is this scripted at all?</p></div></article><article id="post-6622" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 15th, 2017, 9:52:45 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>This is an EzScripted item.

<p>If there is a typo in the above messaging, please ASSIST and request a referral to speak to a GameMaster to fix it.  DO NOT BUG or BUGITEM the gauntlet!</p>

<p>You can tell that the gauntlet's pockets could not possibly get any deeper, but you might be able to have a talented merchant lighten the cast bronze gauntlet for you.</p></div></article><article id="post-6624" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 15th, 2017, 10:21:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Another one sold on LNET for 5 Million.
