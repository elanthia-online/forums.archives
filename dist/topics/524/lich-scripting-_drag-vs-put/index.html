Does anyone know much about the differences between these two commands? In either case, the commands would be operating over item ID's, so the commands won't have to deal with any ambiguity in items.</p></div></article><article id="post-5699" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 1st, 2017, 2:23:01 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>It's also one less network request for most use cases</p></div></article><article id="post-5700" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ineum</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 1st, 2017, 5:30:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Where does it save a network request?

So it can move directly from one container to another, but it is less helpful if it's something you already have in your hand by some other cause (e.g. foraging, doing something else that requires it to be in hand to operate).
