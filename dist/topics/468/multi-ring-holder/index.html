<p>I have a gold ring holder with 'fancy' lightning teleportation messaging.  Holds 5 rings, you can set each ring individually and cycle through the rings.  You can LOOK at the bracer to see which setting you're using.  Wrist worn.</p>

<p>a glaes-paneled slim mithril bracer
LOOK:
 A single pane of transparent glaes is set in the top side of the bracer.  Visible beneath the glaes is an intricate set of small gold-etched brass cogs and copper gears edged in faenor.  Thin gold wire, inlaid into the surface of the silvery mithril, flows toward the dial on the side of the bracer.
The bracer bears a small circular slot fitted with a narrow gold ring, which is encircled by a slender dial bearing five peculiar runes.  It is currently positioned at the second setting.</p>

<p>ANALYZE:
You analyze your slim mithril bracer and sense that the item is largely free from merchant alteration restrictions.</p>

<p>The creator has also provided the following information:
The slim mithril bracer is fully alterable.</p>

<p>This slim mithril bracer is set for fancy messaging.  It is currently set to lightning messaging.</p></div></article><article id="post-4939" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Epona</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, September 11th, 2017, 9:26:43 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Bump.</p></div></article><article id="post-4950" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 12th, 2017, 12:38:35 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>looks pretty cool. hard to set a mb, maybe 3-5 mil?</p></div></article></div></body></html>
