But I'd like some sort of functionality where I can subscribe to a particular thread (or series of threads), and have an option to view just those threads.</p>

<p>Right now I can either view the full folder structure, Unread Posts, Recent Posts, Recent Tags, 'Hot' posts (which are wildly misleading), and that's all.  I want some sort of 'default' page that just shows my subscribed (or watched) topics / folders / whatever.  Since we're at the 'messing around with the interface' stage, I thought I'd bring it up.</p>

<p>And if there's a way to already do this, and I'm just missing it, fantastic, and could someone explain it to me?  :)</p></div></article><article id="post-899" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 9:20:20 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>you can change your home page to <code>/user/&lt;username&gt;/watched</code> under settings for this functionality.</p>
