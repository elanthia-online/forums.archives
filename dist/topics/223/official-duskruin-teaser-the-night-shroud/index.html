<p>As you swathe yourself in the blackened cloak, it seemingly shifts as it takes on a darker hue.</p>

<p>As an Ithzir adept attacks you a cyclone of shadows emerge from your blackened cloak. The shadows swirl around in an attempt to conceal you!
You attempt to blend with the surroundings, and feel confident that no one has noticed your doing so.</p>

<p>About</p>

<p>This uses the hide system and will take into account the normal factors. It can flare/proc on cast or attack from a creature.</p>

<p>Those with at least 1x in hiding will get different messaging on some of the verbs.</p>

<p>The item has 1 fluff tier and up to 5 auction tiers. They are separate unlock paths.</p>

<p>Each auction unlock gives you a 1% chance to have your cloak attempt to hide you. This starts at 0% without any unlocks and maxes out at 5% at a maximum.</p>

<p>Where do I buy it?</p>

<p>They are somewhere in Bloodriven Village...</p>

<p>They won't be cheap and the unlocks are even less so. There will only be up to the 3rd auction unlock available this Duskruin; all of which will be a limited quantity.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>But you need something to look forward to working on after your ithzir is capped.</p></div></article><article id="post-2136" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Destrier</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 17th, 2017, 8:29:24 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>At one chance per year, it is unlikely any will be capping Ithziri armor anytime soon.

<p>I went back into the shop and changed all the cloaks off the shelf to be max light and deep.</p>

<p>If you purchased one and it is not max light deep yet, please place an assist and someone will apply it to yours.</p>

<p>If you purchased one and used waivers to L/D, please place an assist and someone will replace the used waivers as well as max L/D it.</p>

<p>(RE: The possibility of adding the Night Shroud scripting via a cert to existing cloaks)</p>

<p>It'd have to remain on a cloak. I'm not sure when/if a cert would be available for application to existing. I'll look into it.</p>

<p>They have a duster. I think they mean it'd have to stay on a cloak worn item, not so much the noun "cloak"</p>

<p>Here's all the choices.</p>

<p>a lengthy olive-hued duster adorned with a solitary onyx    cloak worn</p>

<p>a moth-eaten pumpkin orange cotton duster</p>

<p>a simple crimson-splotched silk cape</p>

<p>a grass-stained brocade cape with parallel-threaded accents</p>

<p>a soft ecru linen cloak with detailed bright red hemming</p>

<p>a long cream and ochre velvet cloak</p>

<p>a milky purple damask greatcloak with a tentacle-shaped clasp</p>

<p>a mithglin-buttoned billowing black greatcloak</p></div></article><article id="post-3325" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 3:23:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Jacket or death!</p></div></article><article id="post-3873" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 5:49:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Quote from GM Rester: http://forums.play.net/forums/GemStone%20IV/Paid%20Events:%20Adventures,%20Quests,%20and%20SimuCoins/Duskruin%20Arena/view/8036</p>

<p>Hey all, the Night Shroud cloak will no longer cost you stamina when it hides you. That was unintended and has been removed.</p>
