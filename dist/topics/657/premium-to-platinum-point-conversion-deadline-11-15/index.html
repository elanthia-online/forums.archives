<p>At least I thought I did.  I'm not sure I'm bought into the Simucoin compare.  But I did consider it this way - I could increase Platinum subscriptions by 10% alone (totally made up and fabricated, but I'll be the team could come up with that actual number) just by allowing it.  Why?  Because Premium is starved for this (just as Plat is, presumably).  In truth, the <em>only</em> advantage in Plat's favor is - extra money?  So why not send that both directions if it leads to revenue?</p>

<p>Explain more about your simucoin comparison though - that doesn't even register to me yet.  I'm not talking about trading in points for dollars or subscription discounts (yet - put give me another 5 years of Platinum Point accrual, and I just might).</p></div></article><article id="post-7306" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kragdruk</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, November 7th, 2017, 4:25:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The Simucoin example was just a generalization of</p>

<p>I actually don't think that's how this playerbase works. Now that they have offered Premium to Plat conversion, people are going to ask them about converting the other way. If I was Simu, I would say something like "Not now, but maybe we'll consider it in future" which is honest even if it is very unlikely they plan to ever offer it. Unless they outright confirm it will never happen, a non-trivial amount of people will speculatively upgrade to Platinum just in case it happens because double Premium Points for an extra $10 per month seems attractive. I suspect that some non-Plat players already have Plat subscriptions for this reason.</p></div></article><article id="post-7307" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, November 7th, 2017, 4:33:55 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I know it won't happen, but I'd love to see a platinum to prime point conversion.

<p>Oh, I hear ya - I'm not saying it 'must' but it certainly 'could', and there's reasons for perhaps.</p>

<p>I'm curious why there's some sense of 'justified' though - especially given the quote above.  I agree that they are separate.  That's how they were implemented.  And like other players, I'm sitting on a store of Platinum points.  Why this is the case is . . . a different matter.  But if there's pools of them on both sides I still haven't seen a convincing argument that there should only be one way 'allowed'.</p></div></article><article id="post-7310" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kithus</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, November 7th, 2017, 8:14:48 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I think the major difference to consider is that Platinum players are FORCED to have a Premium subscription.

It kind of faded off without a solid "We are no longer planning to do this" proclamation, to my best knowledge (but I was out of the loop for a few years).  So, being able to use accumulated plat points in prime was a goal at one point, at least. Still would really like to see that come to fruition.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
