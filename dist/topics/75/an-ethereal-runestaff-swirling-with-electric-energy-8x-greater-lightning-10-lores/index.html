<p>Looking to offload a number of high value items over the next few weeks and thought I'd start with my Auction win from last December since I've had a few people ask me about it recently. Bidding will go the usual once, twice, then sold. I can delivery to most towns (not Teras, sorry) but would prefer FWI if possible.</p>

<p><strong>Max light 8x runestaff with greater lightning flares and a +10 bonus to both Water and Air lores.</strong> </p>

<p>I've had no personal experience with it but Sighisoara has been using it since and I know he was impressed with it (as a Charl mage).</p>

<p>It traps a few verbs:</p>

<p>GET ~ As xxx draws an ethereal runestaff swirling with electric energy, luminescent slivers of electricity slither about its surface.</p>

<p>RUB ~ xxx's ethereal runestaff is set aglow as crackling ribbons of luminescent blue electricity creep about its surface.</p>

<p>WAVE ~ xxx waves her ethereal runestaff through the air and its surface is bathed in intertwined tendrils of luminescent blue energy.</p>

<p>WAVE (target) ~ xxx tilts his ethereal runestaff at you, and a crackling wisp of glowing blue energy zips forth and glides around you before dispersing into the air.</p>

<p>RAISE ~ xxx raises her ethereal runestaff into the air, and suddenly a whirling zephyr of light wreaths around her. The energy builds in intensity like the heart of a thunderstorm until her entire body is cloaked in the blazing aura. Slowly the maelstrom subsides with a barely-audible rumble, but xxx's eyes appear far more luminous. (temporarily changes your eye colour to "intense deep blue eyes"). </p>

<p><strong>MB: 50m
CB: 55m Red (PC)
BO: 100m</strong></p>

<p>Note: I've set a very high BO as I'd prefer it to be an open auction but if you're willing to pay it, then it's yours!</p></div></article><article id="post-399" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">GS4Menos</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 3:09:02 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>50</p></div></article><article id="post-400" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Cabolt</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 3:11:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Does this have any ensorcells and/or have attempts been made as to the difficulty?</p></div></article><article id="post-401" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 3:12:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>That's a nice staff</p></div></article><article id="post-410" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rohese</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 3:56:27 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>No ensorcells and no attempts made as yet so can't comment on that, I'm afraid.</p>
