<p>Some great information here: http://forum.gsplayers.com/showthread.php?85427-Curse-Voodoo-Doll</p>

<p>This is the same thing that went out as a T6 pull this year, so buy your very own T6!</p>

<p>3x/day you can attune it to another characvter and then PINCH or STAB it and see the target grimace in pain, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>wave my doll at XXXXX  (Lvl 1 waving it at a Lvl 100)
  That's not a good idea.  XXXXX could probably wipe the floor with you.</p>
  
  <p>wave doll at XXXXX  (Lvl 100 waving it at a Lvl 1)
  Your doll shakes for a moment and then falls silent.</p>
  
  <p>pinch my doll
  You grab at the fabric of your doll and squeeze it tightly between your fingers.  The doll glows bright red for a moment, then fades.
  XXXXX flinches as if something just pinched him!</p>
  
  <p>You stab the doll's left eye with one of its accompanying pins, pushing it deep into the stuffing!
  XXXXX grimaces as he quickly grabs at his left eye!</p>
