<p>With an Embassy in Illistim and an Ambassador.  I would like to ask for a clerk to be assigned to the embassy for Faendryl dark elves to request citizenship.  Perhaps with a nominal silver fee since they cannot run around new Ta'Faendryl getting known.</p>

<p>Dark elves being a huge part of the player population, it would be nice to have a way for those desiring to, band together under the banner of the Patriarch, even if they live in the outlands (everywhere that is not New Ta' Faendryl).</p>

<p>I do wish there was an outpost on each side of the Spine where Faendryl might be able to sell without the problems as well.  This would have the potential to work well with that.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
