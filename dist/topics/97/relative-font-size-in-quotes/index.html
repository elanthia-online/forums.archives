<p>It took me until just now to realize it. i was registering a general confusion of comprehension as I was reading messages and trying to decipher what was being talked about.</p>

<p>I kinda think this is a UX gotcha. If someone were using the quote for a callout on a long piece, the larger font would make sense.</p>

<p>But when it is a reference to something that is now going to be further addressed, it just makes my brain hurt, I guess.</p>

<p>I'm hoping there's an easy CSS fix to this.</p></div></article><article id="post-616" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 2:37:09 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Should just be a quick rem size change in the theme css if they want to change it, yeah.</p>

<p>After that happens we will reassess what needs to be done.</p>

<p>Please realize (and we the admins all made this mistake first) it is no easy task to simply install a plugin, the NodeBB plugin space is very large with a lot of varying quality of code.  We made the mistake of willynilly turning plugins on initially in our glee of customization and accidentally borked the live database, and while I have rolling hourly backups to S3 running, I would prefer not to have to use them and have unscheduled downtime.</p>

<p>I already added a good bit of custom css to make it more friendly to the mobile experience, and your general critiques about margins and paddings being "off" are not incorrect, they are not a critical issue compared to some others.</p></div></article><article id="post-723" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 5:34:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Single quotes aren't so bad, but nested quotes are god-damn awful.</p></div></article><article id="post-766" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Luxelle</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 7:00:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Just make the blockquote style the same size text as everything else...</p></div></article><article id="post-769" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 7:11:23 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@luxelle said in <a href="/post/643">Relative Font Size in Quotes</a>:</p>

<p>Not really, it used quote bubbles to make the quote in the quote clearer. I was never a big fan of the forced italicizing.</p>

<p>You're right, but my misconception of how they're formatted still shows they're better, heh.
