<p>First, the standard rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>You may only talk about this game in this thread ~~and in an appropriately named spoiler in the Discussion Thread~~. If you are not playing this game, you may not post in this thread.</li>
<li>You may not play to lose. This will be dealt with at the mod's discretion (expect an immediate modkill if you play against your faction).</li>
<li>Do not lurk. Replacements are not an option. Be active and don't put yourself in the position to be modkilled please.</li>
<li>You may not edit your posts.</li>
<li>You may not post your role PM, or quote verbatim from it. You may paraphrase.</li>
<li>Votes and questions must be posted in</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>bold, on a newline.</strong></p>

<p>You may also ask questions to the mod in PM.
7. You may not post game content in this thread after you are dead. (You may post death flavor.) If you are lynched, you are dead when the deadline is reached. Else, you are dead when the mod says so.
8. You may not post game content at night. It is night when the aforementioned deadline is reached.
9. You may not devise codes or otherwise arrange to pass information along as a means of trying to break the game.  This also covers a general play in the spirit of the game and fairplay catch-all.
10. The mod's decisions are final.</p>

<p>At this time, due to limitation of the forums, I do not think spoiler tags exist, and as such, a discussion thread would be impossible to have without them.  If someone can figure them out, then we could have one, but I've spent enough time looking and trying, and can't see how to do them in any guides. :(</p>

<p><strong>Town -</strong> </p>

<p>Rolename: Wizard <br />

<p>Rolename: Warrior <br />

Many who had been there recently reported those they thought allies to be killing them upon revival at town.  You all are part of a large group that went to the inn to investigate the situation, and if true, to kill the offending creatures, retrieve the dangerous magical items, and make the grounds safe for others to venture into once again.  As you explore the tunnels, a loud shriek draws your attention.  The party gathers together just in time to hear a ghostly voice say, "Why did you kill me..." as it trails off, the corporeal remains decaying away into nothingness.  One of you remarks, "Oh no!  They got the cleric!"</em></p>

<p><em>Those left decided to gather back together at the tables upstairs to discuss the situation, but when you got up there, you notice that your group seems bigger than it was before, but none of you are quite sure who belongs and who doesn't.  The situation borders on the edge of erupting into full on violence, when one of you voice that perhaps a more democratic solution could alleviate the problem.  Fearing for the loss of another deed, the group gathered together to hear the plan warily.</em></p>

<p><em>"We should seal the Inn shut, to prevent others from coming in here and confusing the situation further, we can discuss who among us has been replaced, and collectively send them to Lorminstra's graces."  There was some clamoring, but eventually all agreed to the terms, and the doors and windows were sealed.  Everyone reconvened at the tables to began discussions, hands on weapons, and spells at the ready.</em></p>

<p><strong>Day One has officially stated!  You may now post in the game thread!  I am going to not set a deadline for this first game yet, as long as discussion is happening and people are being active.  That said, I can't imagine it going beyond two weeks at the absolute longest.  This would be far longer than a normal game, but with so many new players, I want to give people the chance to learn and play.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Seven players left alive, four needed to end the day with a lynch!  Good Luck!</strong></p></div></article><article id="post-2375" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Estild</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 19th, 2017, 11:47:55 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Can anyone account for @Maylan when we heard the death cry?</p></div></article><article id="post-2378" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 19th, 2017, 11:51:43 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Standing off the side as the group bickered and fought, Whick sneered and took a drag off his cigarette. The only reason he'd come was to have a chance at getting one of those crystals, nut now it seems he was stuck with this group of misfits and incompetents. He didn't know any of em much, nor did he care particularly about what happened to them, but he'd be damned if he was going to let some ruffians slaughter people willy-nilly. After all, if things got bloody...well, he'd worn his good cloak. Who has silvers to just be taking it to be cleaned all the time?</p>

<p>Sighing, he walks over to the table they are all bickering at and speaks up.</p>

<p>"Ok ok folks. Calm down. We need to figure out who's who real quick. I'll start." Clearing his throat, he stands a bit straighter and introduces himself. "Whick. And I aint ever killed anyone that didn't deserve it. Or that I wasnt paid to kill. Or who didn't try to come between me and a woman. Or..." coughing, he stops and admits "Well, nevermind.

<p>For worms, brave Estild! fare thee well, great heart! Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk! When that this body did contain a spirit, A kingdom for it was too small a bound, but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead. Bears not alive so stout a gentleman. If thou were sensible of courtesy, I should not make so dear a show of zeal, but let my favors hide thy mangled face, and, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself. For doing these fair rites of tenderness. Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven! Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave, but not remembered in thy epitaph! </p>

<p>"I was in the tunnels collecting samples for our research. I was digging up a particularly stubborn rock with a very sharp pickaxe when suddenly the rock screamed at me.

<p>But, I still think this is a pretty interesting rock.

This week, in addition to the petting, I also had to measure all the marmots for their marmot day costumes, and also confetti slings. This year's theme is "marmots", so all the marmots will be wearing marmot costumes. It's basically double the marmot.

<p>Actually, I agree with you. I believe I have correctly identified you as either our cleric killer or an orc.</p>

<p>If I were an orc, how would I conduct myself within this company? I would play innocent by  advocating for peace while sitting back and revealing as little as possible about myself. My responses would be as brief as possible - the less information provided, the less the townspeople would have to judge me with. This would allow me to elude scrutiny while the townspeople argue amongst themselves. If you care to review our conversation so far, you will notice this very pattern. </p>

<p>idlewanderlust's plan was to lay low while we take each other out. Perhaps if their ruse had been a touch more subtle I would have fallen for it.</p></div></article><article id="post-3370" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 9:48:24 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Yes, my plan was to let you take each other out by... trying to get people to not take anyone out.

<p>My friend here is clearly upset about the events that occurred last night, (Maylan's lip quivers) surely that's why he has no appetite.

<p>As for me, I was giving Fitzy here a make-over. (Maylan tilts her pet rock back and forth on the table, causing it to do a little dance). Afterwards, Fitzy and I discussed all of our hopes and dreams for the future as I slowly drifted to sleep. Last night I had a strange dream about rocks and orcs locked in a epic battle.

Discarding his ancient bread on the counter, he scrambled down from the bar and raced towards @Hips, stopping and standing uncomfortably close to her. He sniffed vigorously for a moment, let out a scoff, and then spoke,</p>

<p>"I myself was washing my <em>TOTALLY NATURAL</em> hair..."</p>

<p>he paused, throwing an angry glance upwards in @Hips' direction through his blindfold before continuing.</p>

<p>"...when I was shocked, SHOCKED to hear a big fat nothing at all even. And I hear all the things on account of being the Great Kobold's one true Herald. Whoever is the bad murderer, which is Estild probably, who shall hereafter be referred to as whoever, did it quiet. Estild is silent but deadly, like dog farts! And that's only one step below elf farts on the scale of evilness. I rest my cake."</p>

<p>Apparently finished speaking, possibly forever, though it's doubtful anyone would be that lucky, Flimbo rifled through his satchel before announcing "I'm out of cake..." with a mournful sigh.</p>

<p>"Also @Hips is possibly a murderer. I'm afraid she'll kill me because of jealousy. Also also, I'm afraid for poor Fitzy, who deserves a long, full life of peace. Plus Estild is definitely a bad murderer, not only just possibly like Hips."</p>

<p>Flimbo then quieted, standing perfectly still for a long moment. Then he began to twitch subtly. Then he began to twitch not so subtly. Then he began scratching his arms as if he had poison ivy,</p>

<p>"Also MARMOTS."</p>

<p>He sighed, relieved, then quieted down for good.</p></div></article><article id="post-3955" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Estild</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 11:12:09 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I was standing right here, the same place I've been every night and the same place I'll be every night henceforth.</p>

While there is normally flavor involved to make the game more interesting, and roles assigned, I have never seen such a level of RP dedicated to a game before.  I said all along, I wasn't going to interfere or interject how to play, since that wouldn't be fair of me to do so.  That said, if I were a town player in this game, I would have nipped that immediately.  While it's good and all for fun and starting off, once you had some information to go on, people were posting entirely fluff posts with no real game context, talking about the setup, game, tells, scum hunting, at all, and getting away with it.  This is commonly known as active lurking, you are posting and looking like an active player, without actually helping town win.</p>

<p>I am just going to go post-by-post and look for stand out things to me, that yes, with the knowledge of foresight as the mod, should have none the less stood out in a normal game.</p>

<p>First off, lets deal with Day one, and @0zymandius and his cop claim.  First, you took him right to the cusp of being lynched immediately.  He was a claimed cop, with no one else counterclaiming him.  This should have made him a confirmed townie, and he never should have been lynched.  His claim about having an investigation result was the result of him not understanding that game days and real days are not the same thing, but none the less, no one contested this claim.  Lynching an uncontested town power role claim is very rarely a good plan, unless there is other information in play from other power roles, which in this case, there most certainly was not.  The worst part was, the mafia didn't even have the dirty their hands on it, it was three town players who lynched him.  This was a serious blow against the town.</p>

<p>Even towards the end, there was a lot of random voting, and voting for no reason.  This was largely ignored come day two, and should have been looked at.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I'd say @Maylan played the most like a town player this game, holding off on easy lynches, withholding voting looking for more info, trying to start discussion, that was not a good sign for town as well.  The general low activity, short posts, and active lurking though using the flavor to RP with, severely hurt town.</p>

<p>All that said, @Maylan should have been lynched Day Two immediately!  One of the most common scum tells out there, so common it's specifically documented, is the "oh, last night went bad!" humble brag from a mafia member in their post.  This was a huge scum tell that was missed.  She then told @idlewanderlust she didn't think they were mafia anymore, based on nothing.  This should have been a red flag of a mafia player trying to buddy up with a townie by givng them "townie" status.  @Flimbo basically did everything he possibly could do to make himself seem like an orc, and got away with it thanks to that buddying.</p>

<p>In the end, both sides made some big mistakes that I hope everyone can learn from, and hopefully everyone had fun and would like to play again when I post for a new game soon.  Some specific feedback though.</p>

<p>@Estild and @Hips are the only two players that I knew of that played mafia before, though not in the forum format.  As a general guide, on the forums its a lot of analysis and reanalysis of people's posts, trying to pick up inconsistencies, or possible scum tells.  The general idea is, that on some level, people want to reveal their roles subconsciously, and that manifests in wording and inconsistent play.</p>

<p>@HJFudge random voting between players constantly is not a good town play generally.  When done without reason, it makes you appear at best an unhelpful townie, and at worst, scummy.</p>

<p>@idlewanderlust You basically got bandwagoned the crap out of D1 due to the mafia targetting you with votes, since you were quiet.  You were a case of low hanging fruit as it's called, meaning you were an easy lynch target.  You even stated that scum were revealing themselves by voting for you, and in fact you were correct.  A common observation is that third on a bandwagon (a rapidly forming vote against one player) is scum, and that was @Flimbo.  While I think @Hips and @Estild picked up on that, you let scum buddying up to you sway you to their side.  You should be more suspicious when someone calls you townie without having a reason, especially when they led a lynch on you the day before.</p>

<p>@0zymandius we already talked a bit in PM about this, for the benefit of others though, I'll go over it here.  You should never claim to be the cop like this unless you have a scum result, or are about to be lynched.  In some games, claiming to be the cop early on, and playing "follow the cop" is a valid strat, since the doctor can protect the cop at night, and the cop can collect results.  In this game though, there was a mafia roleblocker.  You never would have gotten a single result after claiming had the mafia played it right.  You effectively turned yourself into a confirmed vanilla townie, who for reasons beyond me, was lynched despite no one counter claiming to be the cop.</p>

<p>This brings me to the Mafia players.  Despite her massive scum tells Day two, I'd say the MVP goes to @Maylan this game.  She worked out a number of strats for day town overnight, and made plans for her and @Flimbo to follow.  Coupled with her largely townie play, I'd say she did well.  @Flimbo if this game had a jester role (Goal, to be lynched to win) I'd say you were an awesome jester.  As a scum member, I honestly don't know how you weren't lynched.  This largely was the fault of the continued RP active lurking posts i'd imagine.  This is a great example of why town players should be very suspicious of someone who active lurks like this, and not participate in it, or encourage it.</p>

<p>Overall, mistakes were made by both side, and either side could have won it.  It was a good learning experience I hope if nothing else.  If you have any feedback for me, any further questions on how to play, general strat, ect, please let me know.  If you'd be interested in playing another round of it, let me know as well.  I've had some outside interest, and I hope that others silently watching have grown more interested themselves, and would love to host a larger game next time, as it allows for more role diversity.  Thank you for playing!</p></div></article><article id="post-4004" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Claudaro</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 10:17:29 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=JEEP%27s<em>Tells</em>for<em>Finding</em>Mafia</p>

<p>Secondly, @Flimbo doesn't act in ways to seem more orc-like. Orcs aspire to be like @Flimbo.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I was not RPing. This is just how I am in real life.</p>

<p>Double-thirdly:</p>

<p>In the failing light of day, the Upper Trollfang was quiet, until a shuffling could be heard from behind the closed doors of the abandoned inn. And then, all of the sudden, the doors burst open, and instantly the Trollfang was awash in a sea of skittering and scurrying feet, as launched from its humble entryway came Flimbo, atop a sled born of lashed together corpses, being pulled by a team of Marmots. In a flash they were there and then gone, as Flimbo and his new bride Fitzy rode off into the sunset.</p>

<p>Thus concludes this game of Marmot Time Surprise, featuring Flimbo and his faithful sidekick @Maylan. This has been a social experiment to see how long it would take people to figure out that you were in fact not playing forum Mafia, but Marmot Time Surprise. This has been a successful experiment. We hope to see you all at the Marmot Day Parade.</p>

<p>TL;DR: A+ Seller. Fun game. Would murder you all and feed you to marmots again. Look forward to the next one.

As idle mentioned, I did the "bleak post" in an effort to mimic the posting style of the other townies. At that time it felt suspicious to just jump right into the game play when others were pausing to say "that did not go well." But as to my behavior towards idle, yes it should have been obvious the way I was flip-flopping stances when I was so adamantly against them the day before.</p>

<p>I actually think the bigger tell was the obvious collaboration between Flimbo and I on Day 2. At one point we used almost the exact same language to describe Estild. </p>

<p>I thought Flimbo made a smart move by switching votes to break a tie and vote for me. It was a harmless vote that counted for nothing, and a misdirection.</p>

<p>I thought the RP made the game play more fun - because after all we are a bunch of RP nerds. But i do agree that I was hoping for more active game content to make things more interesting.</p>

<p>I would 100% be interested in another game.</p>

<p>That being said.....</p>

<p>(Late one night, Maylan creeps into @Flimbo 's orc den. Silently, slowly, she runs her blade across Flimbo's throat. He gurgles incoherently as blood spills forth through his clenched fingers. Maylan kicks his corpse in the side for good measure, as this is what orc sidekicks do.)</p>

<p>Steal MY best friend, will you? I think not. @Hips was correct all along. I was in it for the wig. (Maylan places the now bloodied wig on Fitzy.

<p>Yeah, I have to admit that that I wasn't a huge fan of that aspect (not to diminish the effort that many of you put into it though, it was great), which is also why I didn't participate in the roleplaying or trying to justify "where I was".  Neither of those are useful for trying to determine which team someone is on, which should be the focus.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I'm going to disagree with this analysis.  Even if I was the cop, I would not counterclaim him so early in the game.  Anytime the cop comes forward, they immediately put themselves at risk to be targeted by the mafia.  The doctor can only protect one person, so why would you immediately put yourself at risk to come forward to counterclaim - the doctor has to pick between you and someone else to protect at night, which are not great odds.  In such a scenario, I find it's best for the real cop to immediately target the false cop (by encouraging others to lynch him/her) without coming forward.  More so, from my perspective, @0zymandius accused me of being the mafia, which I absolutely knew I was not, so in my eyes, I was 100% positive he was the mafia since I knew he made a false statements.  No matter how that round turned out, I was going to vote to lynch him every day until his death.  Ultimately, the issue was due to learning the game instead of actually playing it though, which happens.</p></div></article><article id="post-4047" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 10:30:21 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@estild said in <a href="/post/4046">Intrigue at the Abandoned Inn (Mafia Game Thread)</a>:</p>

  <p>I'm going to disagree with this analysis.  Even if I was the cop, I would not counterclaim him so early in the game.  Anytime the cop comes forward, they immediately put themselves at risk to be targeted by the mafia.  The doctor can only protect one person, so why would you immediately put yourself at risk to come forward to counterclaim - you put yourself at huge risk and the doctor has to pick between you and someone else to protect at night.

<p>Yeah... I was confused about 'night', and assumed that it was RL night.  I'd intended to 'cast my spell' the first RL night, but got swept away with school and other stuff, so tried to cover my tracks (poorly).  I'm chalking it up to a learning experience all the way around, and looking forward to giving it another try.</p></div></article><article id="post-4051" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 31st, 2017, 10:43:22 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm going to go ahead and disagree with Estild's disagreement about the RP aspect of things. Firstly, without the RP aspect of things, there would have been 100% fewer marmots in this game, and that's a loss we can all agree is unacceptable. </p>

<p>Second, when I first started with RP posts I was doing so mainly  to keep the thread moving because it felt like it had super stalled out at times.</p>

<p>And third, I dropped hints that I was mafia in my RP posts accidentally. The more you say, the more you reveal, regardless of what you're saying. I also dropped hints intentionally that were suggestive of a townie kind of feel, but if you really read into my RP posts, you'll see some slip ups that were super giveaways that I was mafia, both based on timing of post and word usage. </p>

<p>I think that the RP aspect can be both a solid tool to stay alive and also a double edged sword because you may say too much with your grammar. To the former, if what you're saying is interesting enough, funny enough, or otherwise engaging, people might just choose someone else to lynch over you because they wouldn't mind seeing what you have to say next. I'm not saying that was the case in this particular scenario, but the idea is sound enough.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
