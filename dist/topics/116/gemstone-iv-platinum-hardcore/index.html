<p>Welcome to Gemstone IV Plaitnum HARDCORE. This contest started out as a personal challenge that garnered enough interest to bring others on board. The basic essence of the contest is simple. You make a new character, in Gemstone IV Platinum, and if the character dies, you are out. With that basic premise out of the way we will get into the various rules that need to be put into place to ensure a fair competition. Please keep in mind that this contest is run primarily on an honor system and we are trusting participants to follow the rules. </p>

<p>Contest Rules:</p>

<li><p>All participates, upon creation, must be posted in the Gemstone IV Platinum HARDCORE thread. This includes name, race and profession. They must be created after July 17th, 2017.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon death you should submit a post to the thread informing the community of the character’s death and immediately delete the character. Inventory may be transferred to a non-HARDCORE character prior to deletion.</p></li>
<li><p>HARDCORE characters must be self-spelled. This means no outside spells, aside from group spells, may be used. Spells the character can activate themselves from Magic Items or Scrolls are permitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Items and silver may not be obtained from other characters. This means nothing may be received from another character or player shop.
