20 Points of Critical Weighting</p>

<p>You carefully inspect your dark red eahnor plate.</p>

<p>Your careful inspection of a suit of dark red eahnor plate with obsidian-winged pauldrons allows you to conclude that it is plate armor that covers the torso, arms, legs, neck, and head.</p>

<p>You determine that you could wear the plate around your chest.  The plate appears to serve some purpose.</p>

<p>It looks like this item has been mainly crafted out of eahnor.</p>

<p>Trying to get a rough idea of value.  Taking reasonable offers as well.</p></div></article><article id="post-6602" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 15th, 2017, 8:21:23 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Love the red and black look.

So much has happened since the last few sets of MCPed plate sold on the open market.  Coins cratered, dark vultite stuff sold 'en mass, plus all the padding and enchant changes.  If I was going for it and it was being auctioned, I'd be expecting to pay in the 75-100m range.  That is my best guess anyway.</p></div></article><article id="post-6611" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 15th, 2017, 9:21:46 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>No show?</p></div></article><article id="post-6615" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 15th, 2017, 9:25:19 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>No show.
