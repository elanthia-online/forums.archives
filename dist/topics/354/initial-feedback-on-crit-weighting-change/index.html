<p>I've been at DR all week. Here's my stats for the past 2 DR's.</p>

<p>Arena Entries:           291
  Arena Kills:            6948
  Arena Wins:              178
  Arena Perfect Wins:       73</p>

<p>6x MCW T5 falchion, typically fight in the open and augment with Cman Vanish and Ambush.</p>

<p>Just did 3 Arena runs, and even had a non lore Tonis / Kai one run.</p>

<p>Didn't finish one.</p>

<p>Perhaps crit randomization has a wider range and it's possible with a 500 PT weighting it just didn't randomize high enough? IDK</p>

<p>It's clear to me that something has changed.</p>

<p>More challenging now, and losing 20 percent of my scrip earned atm...</p></div></article><article id="post-3454" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 26th, 2017, 8:13:06 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The service points mean nothing when it comes to the combat application.

<p>Never have I lost 3 in a row until now.</p>

<p>It's obvious enough to me that I'll be more of a spectator at this point, but again, I believe the game has moved forward.

<p>I don’t want the negative opinion of the purported smithy bloodscrip costs to take over the discussion of the WPS changes in the hunting folder, so let’s do that here.</p>

<p>Based on the teaser post, using the full 25 services to pad 6x plain armor for 2.5 points would cost 13825 bloodscrip. Adding less than 1 point to 6x hcp armor would cost somewhere between 24k and 70k.</p>

<p>Compare that to the 50k scaling flat-padding cost for heavy padding at previous Duskruins and you see the issue. Potentially, I could now add HCP padding to armor over 6 Duskruins or other events. Let’s assume it’ll cost 20k scrip on average. That’s now 120k where I was expecting 50k. Costs are now 2.4 times the previous ones while I now need 6 times the number of events. For 10x hcp armor, I could previously pay 225k scrip to take it to MCP in one go. Now, to do that I need to add 350 points. That’s 14 max services for a cost that I expect to be staggering (likely 70k x 14=980,000 scrip). The cost has increased ~4.5 times while the events required have increased 14 times. In short, it is no surprise people are disappointed.</p>

<p>The new system is amazing, but the costs here are sky-high for minimal benefits. Please review them.</p>

<p>I think maybe we've been given an in game mechanic that changes everything. People aren't going to be starved for this anymore.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I'm mapping out what to do with my project piece and I would like to know what kind of degredation to temporary enhancements - namely Paladin bonding guiding light flares- will be due to the level of weighting.</p>

<p>That is to say as long as we keep it heavy and under will we not see much degradation on flare rate or damage etc.? What about dual weighting? Will the degradation stack if I get both heavy crit and damage weighting? </p>

<p>Also, shouldn't Paladin bonding be exempt from 'temporary enhancement degradation' this isn't really a bard song enhancement, it's quasi-permanent. Also, a work around exists where one could just add flares to a significantly weighted bonded weapon.</p>

<p>P.S. What about warrior double strike flares? will they be affected?</p>

<p>Thank you for any insight. :)</p></div></article></div></body></html>
