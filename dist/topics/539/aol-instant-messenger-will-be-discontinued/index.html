<p>Dear AIM user,</p>

<p>We see that you've used AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) in the past, so we wanted to let you know that AIM will be discontinued and will no longer work as of December 15, 2017.</p>

<p>Before December 15, you can continue to use the service. After December 15, you will no longer have access to AIM and your data will be deleted. If you use an @aim.com email address, your email account will not be affected and you will still be able to send and receive email as usual.</p>

<p>We've loved working on AIM for you. From setting the perfect away message to that familiar ring of an incoming chat, AIM will always have a special place in our hearts. As we move forward, all of us at AOL (now Oath) are excited to continue building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products for users around the world.</p>

<p>You can visit our FAQ to learn more. Thank you for being an AIM user.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
The AOL Instant Messenger team</p></div></article><article id="post-5973" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 1:00:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I guess it's the last fossilized toe of that old dinosaur.

<p>exactly, it was perfect for our dinosaur game and getting back in touch with people when they returned/sometimes keeping in touch when they left.</p></div></article><article id="post-5975" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Riend</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 1:11:05 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli I'm fairly sad about a number of old contacts I'll lose when it shuts down. =(</p></div></article><article id="post-5976" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 1:11:59 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Guess I'll try Discord.</p></div></article><article id="post-5977" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 1:13:27 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>https://forums.elanthia.online/topic/537/aggregate-chat-clients </p>

You can choose to disable your headphones and mic, so you're not bothered by any sound at all. =) </p>

<p>It's like Teamspeak only with a channel-wide chat function (unlike the chat option I think TS had, or maybe it was Vent, or whatever the flavor-of-the-day raiding voicechat was at the time... so many voicechats.)</p></div></article><article id="post-5982" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 1:46:20 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>That's what I do.

<p>There are definitely plugins, if you're at all savvy with terminal, it looks like. It seems to even use a windows installer for those.</p></div></article><article id="post-6020" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 7:27:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Just use discord</p></div></article><article id="post-6044" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">idlewanderlust</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 6th, 2017, 11:38:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>http://mashable.com/2014/04/15/aim-history/#lfus0R6YEPqY</p></div></article></div></body></html>
