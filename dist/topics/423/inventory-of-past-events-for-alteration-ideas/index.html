There was no way I could figure out to search through all the items on all the pages to look at them at one time. So I went through the previous inventories and compiled a list of what they've offered in the past. So I'm posting it here in case anyone is interested. First thing I'm working on is tunics, going to go through breeches after this.
Now I know this isn't the only way to do this, but I find it helps get my brain working.

<p>[A Dimly Lit Showroom]
An oil lamp suspended from the ceiling beam provides sparse lighting for this showroom. The mannequins before you are attired in black clothing which absorbs much of the available light. Storage boxes are stacked against the outer walls, making it difficult to move about.
Obvious exits: out.</p>

<p>clicky mannequin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see a red-haired mannequin and a pointy-eared mannequin.</p>

<p>clicky pointy-eared mannequin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the pointy-eared mannequin you see a large bone-handled satchel, a magnificent midnight black greatcloak, a double golem bone clasp, a bone-trimmed midnight black tunic, a pair of fitted black leggings, a bone and suede belt and some polished midnight black boots.</p>

I get a lot more inspiration looking at tunics at say a medieval clothing maker than in-game descriptions.  I'm very visual when it comes to that stuff.  One really nice piece of clothing can actually inspire several text pieces for me.</p></div></article><article id="post-4182" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Obsalyn</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 2nd, 2017, 8:35:12 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Thanks Naamit! that's a very interesting site. I went to some of those along time ago, very interesting to see it all again.</p>

<p>And Epona I get that, it just helps me to see the wording and configurations that have been done. I can look at the pictures and try to put it together, but if something exists that would be similar and just need a few tweeks, well that shortcuts it significantly.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
