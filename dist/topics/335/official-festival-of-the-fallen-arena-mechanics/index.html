<p>Thanks to all of the input we received, we've made some adjustments that will hopefully better balance things this year. Not all of this is new, but I'm going to lay out how the arena works at this point.</p>

<p>When you go through the portal into the arena, ALL outside spells are stripped, and then for native casters:
Retribution effect (only) of Cloak of Shadows (712) is stripped
Arcane Barrier (1720), Elemental Targeting (425), and Rapid Fire (515) are stripped</p>

<p>Inside the arena itself:
Most spells over level 10 are now allowed
Implosion (720), Elemental Targeting (425), Censure (316), Judgment (1630), Nature's Fury (635), Sleep (501), Flaming Aura (1706), Spirit Servant (240) are all blocked
Hiding is allowed
No demons, animal companions, or Singing Sword Song (1025)
No wands or embeds</p>

<p>Hopefully, this will help answer some of the questions you may have, and help you to prepare for killing your friends.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'd accidentally left scrolls off of my post, but there are no scrolls, either. I edited my post to reflect that. Blocking 425 is new this year and is part of the balancing updates we're trying, along with stripping outside spells.</p>
