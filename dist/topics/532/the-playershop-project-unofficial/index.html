If desired, skip to the bottom of the post for the TL:DR summary.</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce the completion of the Playershop Project!</p>

<p>The culmination of many weeks of effort, the Playershop Project is the automation of the inventory database of all 9 shopping districts across Elanthia.  Shop listings will be updated roughly once per hour in every town on a perpetual basis. Thanks to the use of Tillmen's Update-playershops script, these databases will be able to be queried using both the Playershops 4.0 and Virilneus's websites:</p>

<p>https://ps.lichproject.org/
http://www.virilneus.com/shops/</p>

<p>Each town (aside from FWI) will be staffed by a level 16 Free-to-Play Wizard who will remain invisible so as not to appear unresponsive to the general populace or spam the shopping district with unneeded screen scroll. Further, the Wizards are all proficient in Arcane Symbols, so feel free to sell your scrolls without worry of the databases being unable to list their spells (The exception being those pesky Fash'lo'nae's Gift scrolls, sorry!). F2P accounts were used in order to ensure that Playershop inventories remain updated even should I decide to stop actively playing and cancel my accounts. Arrangements have been made so that in the event I am unwilling/unable to keep the Wizards running, others can operate them in my stead.</p>

<p>I first and foremost would like to thank Ondreian's player for writing the script (;shopkeeper) used to keep the Wizards up and running, along with generally being an awesome resource for script related questions. I'd also like to thank both Teclys and Zaximus for each providing me with a few of the Wizards at a reasonable cost. Their Wizards allowed me to hit the ground running and keep the primary shopping districts updated while the rest of the bunch were brought to the proper level.</p>

<p>Get out there and start shopping, people!</p>

<p>TL:DR - All playershop inventories will be updated 24-7 via the Lich and Virilneus's websites from now on barring disconnects and what not.</p></div></article><article id="post-5835" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, October 4th, 2017, 11:11:43 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Very nice</p></div></article><article id="post-5841" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Tenser</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, October 5th, 2017, 12:51:56 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Yes, this is great.

<p>Offer is appreciated. All money involved has already been spent, so at this point it's just about minimal upkeep.</p></div></article><article id="post-6162" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Naamit</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 8th, 2017, 1:42:02 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Hi, I think there might be an issue with purchased items not being removed from the shop inventory lists upon refresh.  For example, Faraighn's Magic Shoppe on lichproject.org says it has "some fine sanguine flakes" for sale and that its inventory was updated 10 mins prior to me having searched for them.  But I purchased them all last night and validated again just now that there aren't any more in the shop.</p>

  On the wooden shelf you see a deep blue potion, a tincture of yabathilium, a lesser mana regeneration potion, a luminous ruddy potion, a scintillating lilac potion, a greater mana potion, a swirling grey potion, some milky blue oil and a dimly glowing sky-blue potion.</p>

The likelihood of someone buying them all within 10 minutes of the update &amp; me me visiting again (I wanted to buy more) is pretty slim.

If for some reason the script is faulty, the problem would be with Tillmen's script or the website. I'd suggest reaching out to him on Discord and see what he has to say. I'm working to update the script via the help of someone on Discord myself, but I don't know if it will address this problem.</p></div></article><article id="post-6186" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Naamit</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, October 8th, 2017, 6:10:55 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Well phooey.
