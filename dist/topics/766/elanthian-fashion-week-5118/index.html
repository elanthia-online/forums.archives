<p>Elanthian Elegance will be sponsoring Fashion Week again this year and I aim to schedule it during July in the hope it avoids the busier pay event months. The last two have been a great success so I'm really hoping we can get even more groups/individuals involved this year. For those that have no idea what I'm talking about, you can see more on the <a href="https://gswiki.play.net/Elanthian_Fashion_Week">GS wiki page</a> and I will update it as the schedule comes together for this year. I also hope to hold the usual planning meeting in April and possibly another fundraising auction in May, so watch the calendar!</p></div></article><article id="post-8310" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, January 22nd, 2018, 10:38:02 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Hello Rohese,</p>

<p>The idea I had originally mentioned to you would fit well within this theme. Let me know how to coordinate with you at your earliest convenience.</p></div></article><article id="post-8311" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Rohese</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, January 22nd, 2018, 11:07:29 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Discord is probably the easiest way to reach me, as you did before.  I'm usually around between 2 - 5pm game time during the week; longer on the weekends (time zone differences and all that jazz).  I look forward to seeing what you have in mind!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
