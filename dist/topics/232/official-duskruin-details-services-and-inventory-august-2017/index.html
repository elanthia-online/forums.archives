Let me try to answer a few things.</p>

<p><strong>Scrip Shop</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Everything in this shop scales in price. You will now see the quantity of items that are left for sale when you appraise an item.</p></li>
<li><p>The weapons and armor from last time are returning.</p></li>
<li><p>The enchanting potions have been reduced to 10 charges, and their prices have been adjusted to reflect that.</p></li>
<li><p>The coraesine relic is 500,000 bloodscrip and only 2 will be for sale.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the certificates for sale this time. The certificates all have pertinent information when you READ them. Some have some prerequisites. Prices not listed are the same as last run. </p>

<ul>
<li>a multi-colored greater element document (upgrade a flaring weapon to a greater elemental flare), 30,000 bloodscrip) <strong>NEW</strong></li>
<li>a yellowed rotflare contract (limit of 5, 250,000 bloodscrip) <strong>NEW</strong></li>
<li>a violet permabless note (limit of 5, 250,000 bloodscrip) <strong>NEW</strong></li>
<li>a master instrument sheet (50,000 bloodscrip) <strong>NEW</strong></li>
<li>a white undead bane permit (limit of 5, 400,000 bloodscrip)</li>
<li>a black weight reducing stub</li>
<li>a dark de-fusion certificate</li>
<li>a bleached ironwright contract</li>
<li>a maroon knockout flare debenture</li>
<li>a cyan polearm flare debenture</li>
<li>an opaque bubble flare debenture</li>
<li>a brown open acuity ticket</li>
<li>a puce flat acuity ticket</li>
<li>a golden open mana deed</li>
<li>a silvery flat mana deed</li>
<li><p>a grey target defense voucher</p></li>
<li><p>Weighting, Padding, and Sighting </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The new weighting, padding, and sighting updates will be debuting at Duskruin. Our Development team will talk more about that when it gets launched. Due to it being brand new, it's going to be slightly delayed after the opening of Duskruin. Don't worry though, there are no time-based limits involved with how we're offering this service. You will be limited to having an item worked on 25 times under the new system.</p>

<p>You will earn an invite by participating and winning in the arena. Having a perfect run will also greatly improve your odds of getting an invite. Invitations do not stack, but you can earn another invite after using one. Invites are not a tangible item nor can they be traded.</p>

<p>We plan on having a way to appraise costs before going into the smithy so you know exactly what you're getting yourself involved with. </p>

<p><strong>Bloodforge</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The bloodforge will be temporarily closed until the weighting, padding, and sighting updates are live.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spellbound X/day</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>With the updates to MIU, we're featuring offensive spells this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hate to say it but this is a very disappointing list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a multi-colored greater element document (upgrade a flaring weapon to a greater elemental flare), 30,000 bloodscrip)
  a yellowed rotflare contract (limit of 5, 250,000 bloodscrip)
  a violet permabless note (limit of 5, 250,000 bloodscrip)
  a white undead bane permit (limit of 5, 400,000 bloodscrip)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a quick complaint - none of these allow for anything but the best of the best to be worked on because of the pricing.  Who is going to spend 250 million (Your 1000:1 pricing) or 375 million silvers (BS market price today) to permabless anything below 10x perfect, and even at 10x perfect it's way overpriced.  Why aren't these offered at a scaling price so lower enchant/not already maxed out gear can be added to?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spellbound X/day
  * With the updates to MIU, weâ€™re featuring offensive spells this time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just... no.  Most of that list can be obtained via 420.  I see very few, if any people paying those prices for those spells.  I want access to useful things.  If this was the reason for the MIU updates, that coding time was a waste and would have been better spent on offering scaling pricing for upgrades for all the things offered.

<p>I would guess because it can go on most any weapon.  Before it was set to a specific runestaff.  I wish they would get away from this.  </p>

<p>A service adds a certain value and the base item shouldn't play this big a part in it.</p></div></article><article id="post-2157" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 1:00:11 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>https://gswiki.play.net/Duskruin<em>Arena/August</em>2017<em>prize</em>list</p></div></article><article id="post-2158" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 1:02:26 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Keep in mind, the High End Scrip Shop is less than 1% of the items available at Duskruin. </p>

<p>The high end scrip shop is why I saved 160k bloodscrip from the last run.  It's also why I planned to spend $1000 during this run, but now it doesn't seem to be worth it to go big.</p>

<p>At the very least, I'd like to see the multi-setting teleporters offered again so I actually have something to buy.</p>

<p>My goals for this event were padding 6x HCP armor to MCP,  adding permabless to a 5x handaxe (Which is now way out of the range of possibility due to lack of gear scaling), a multi-setting teleporter (preferably a 12 setting) or AS/TD spells from spellbound.</p>

<p>Instead, we get the same gear offered last run (which is useless to me), 4 new certificates (which are priced to only consider the best of the best - and still super expensive) and spells that can be obtained via 420 and are largely useless to those outside of the class with access to the spell.</p></div></article><article id="post-2160" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 1:17:57 AM</div></div><div class="content"><blockquote>

<p>Regular, off-the-shelf stuff like 5x weapons are maybe 2500-3000k scrip, 4x gear and random containers are generally a few hundred.  You're able to walk around the shops and look at stuff without having to buy passes.</p>

<p>So far the most reasonable offering I've seen teased is forest armor, which it seems you'll be able to buy off the shelf and fully unlock one step at a time via certificates. </p>

<p>The big revamp of the shops usually happens in April, so the list that is on the BV page with some exceptions will likely not change too much. I've already moved the padding shop out.</p>

<p>Same here.  I don't even do that great in the arena, but I'll do it enough myself to afford a couple of the forest armor unlock certs and a couple other odds and ends in the regular shops, then sell off any additional BS and items I find and probably either break even or come out ahead in the end.</p></div></article><article id="post-2205" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ashraam VanEyre</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 11:54:22 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>250,000 bloodscrip is 20 booklets for anyone that can earn 12,500 bloodscrip per 50-count booklet.  Let's say everyone makes mistakes, so you're probably going to average closer to 200 bloodscrip per run - or 10,000 bloodscrip per 50-count booklet.  That's still only 25 books.</p>

<p>50-count booklets are going to run for around 7.5-8mil per booklet,  That means it would cost your skilled player between 150-200mil.  I'd say rot flares are valued for this much based on previous auctions, and silvers have gone down in value.</p>

<p>The next currency you spend is time.  If you've figured out DR, you can actually accomplish this feat in 30-40 hours (that's what I would take me) over the next 10-15 days with 2 characters, or double that if you're only playing one character.  It's entirely achievable. </p>

<p>That's the COST of the item.  You could turn around and sell those 250,000 bloodscrip for a lot more silvers than it takes to obtain them.  The value of the BS includes the amount spent to earn them, time it takes to earn them, and the convenience of getting BS without any effort - which is why 250,000 BS is -worth- 375mil silvers, but it doesn't cost 375mil silvers to farm.</p></div></article><article id="post-2207" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 12:05:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ashraam-vaneyre Its still around $700 if you purchase the books yourself and do it yourself.  </p>

<p>This is a point of confusion for me as well. Everyone I've asked has said that if I get a cert from the high-end shop, I will not be able to add weighting. I'd like to do both, but still a bit confused on whether that will be an option with the automation aspect. Will the weighting still be considered a "service", even though it's been automated?

<p>I think this just highlights other problems. The opening of Duskruin is always a rush to get reasonably priced services before scaling is turned on. If doing so locks you out of using another service, that was advertised as being moved to its own separate area and automated but not being advertised as part of the 1 service per item rule (a long-standing rule of the high end scrip shop) then that's just incredibly poor communication on the part of Simutronics. Locking out items like that would do little to help drain BS and only incur more anger from the people who are involved in those sales. There's been a lot of unhappy discourse on the officials between this and EG changes, adding to it with something like that would only make it worse.</p></div></article><article id="post-2236" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Wyrom</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 1:57:52 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim said in <a href="/post/2224">Official: Duskruin Details: Services and Inventory - August 2017</a>:</p>

<p>You put/get coins into them, and there is some roundtime to it.</p></div></article><article id="post-2823" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ososis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 2:19:03 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ponclast </p>

<p>You need a free hand to load/unload em so you can wear it on belt and do it with one hand, or I stow everything, pull my pouch out and load it by hand.</p>

<p>There is NO RT to put silvers into it, but there IS RT based on total coins when removing them (8RT I think for 10k? Havn't got the 25k yet). So its quick in the field, slow in the bank.</p></div></article><article id="post-2825" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ponclast</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017, 2:20:38 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex said in <a href="/post/2820">Official: Duskruin Details: Services and Inventory - August 2017</a>:</p>

<p>That's surprising. I would have thought they'd be automatic apparently like this item is:</p>

<p>That purse was borked, I ended up returning it (0 hassle). It doesn't hold anything weightless and when I got a GM assist they said it's main draw was "You cant get coins stolen when its closed!".</p>

<p>I think the "Works while in another bag" is meant to mean that the "weightless" aspect works even when the item is not directly WORN. This is the case for the DR bags also, I keep it in my backpack and get full weightlessness.</p>

<p>EDIT: Purse wasn't borked, was just not the kind of purse everyone assumed.</p></div></article><article id="post-4159" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, September 2nd, 2017, 12:24:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Quote from GM Tamuz: http://forums.play.net/forums/GemStone%20IV/Paid%20Events:%20Adventures,%20Quests,%20and%20SimuCoins/Duskruin%20Arena/view/8251</p>

<p>Since the event was extended, the final date to email me by (which is on the certificates you buy) will be September 10th (instead of the September 6th). This date is to get in touch with me. I'll work also try to aim to have them all done by then too, but sometimes there is some back and forth or scheduling issues.</p>

<p>There was an extremely high turnout this run, and likely 4x the amount of certificates sold than any other run to date. I realize a lot of you have emailed for your redemption early on and may still be waiting. We're working through them as quickly as we can.</p>
