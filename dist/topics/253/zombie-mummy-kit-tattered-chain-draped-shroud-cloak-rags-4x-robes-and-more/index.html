I'll leave it up for a day or two then split it up if no one is interested in the complete set.</p>

<p>For the set</p>

<p>mb: 5 mil
bo: 10 mil</p>

<p>A tattered chain-draped shroud, weighs 8, holds significant amount</p>

<p>Some tattered black silk rags - 4x robe/cloth armor</p>

<p>A dirty web-covered satchel - T1 unlocked spider container, comes with 1 spider (a pale red spider with a long thorax)</p>

<p>Some rotted leather sandals - zested, see below</p>

<p><strong>Details on each item below...</strong></p>

<p>SHROUD</p>

<p>Fashioned from what was once fine linen, but is now moldering and tattered, the shroud is stained brown due to long exposure to the earth. The irregular brown hue is streaked throughout with rusty red, bleed from the assorted chains that ensnare the garment. On random links, locks are affixed to the chains to serve as clasps to both support the drape of the garment and draw it closed.</p>

<p>Further Lighten/deepen-able</p>

<p>Zests!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rub shroud
  You rub your chain-draped shroud, causing it to release the sharp, coppery scent of rust mingled with the pungent aroma of wet earth into the air.
  sniff shroud
  You detect the sharp, coppery scent of rust mingled with the pungent aroma of wet earth around the chain-draped shroud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yes, it works when hidden/invisible. People just suddenly detect a sharp, coppery scent of rust mingled with the pungent aroma of wet earth.. and no, they don't see you sniff it.</p>

<p>RAGS</p>

<p>Was told these were from an old invasion.  Just 4x robe/cloth armor.  No idea if these could be made via a merchant alter or not.</p>

<p>SATCHEL</p>

<p>Show: Thick strands of webbing have been woven in a chaotic pattern to create the thick organic mesh of this web-covered satchel.  Hollow insect carcasses and bits of debris are interspersed and impossibly tangled within the walls, while thin web-covered straps extend from its sides.</p>

<p>Can point the spider at items on the ground and it picks it up for you.  More info on that here: https://gswiki.play.net/Spider_bag</p>
