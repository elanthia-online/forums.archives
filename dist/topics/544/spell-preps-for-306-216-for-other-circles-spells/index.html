<hr />

<p>You analyze your glaesine ball and sense that the creator has provided the following information:</p>

<p>This ball, if redeemed, will provide custom bolt messaging for the Holy Bolt (306) spell as such:</p>

<p>You sling lancing arrows of pure divinity at a giant rat!
  Menos slings lancing arrows of pure divinity at a giant rat!</p>

<p>The effect of this token is cosmetic.  It does not increase the effect or damage caused by a spell.  This item does NOT grant spell knowledge.  REDEEMing this item assumes that you already have the ability to cast the spell natively, from a spell knowledge enhancive, or from a magical item.</p>

<hr />

<p>Invoking this thick parchment will grant you permanent access to a special method of preparing your spells.
It will provide the following phrase:</p>

<p>First Person:  Reaching outward, you call upon the spirits of chaos to come to your aid and to empower your [Spell Name] spell.
Third Person:  Menos calls upon the spirits of chaos to come to his aid and to empower his spell.
Hidden or Invisible:  From somewhere nearby, a wild call for aid to the spirits of chaos echoes through the area.</p>

<p>Can message me here, AIM at GS4 Menos or Menos in the discord chat.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
