<p>*Undead Bane Oil Info from RtCF http://gsguide.wikia.com/wiki/Return...<em>Shop</em>Listings:</p>

<p>The undead bane oils may be applied to weapons and armor to impart a temporary undead bane effect corresponding to the type of oil used. Like permanent undead banes, these effects only become active when a weapon is used against undead, or if the armor is struck by undead.</p>

<p>Undead bane oils can only be used on items that do not have an existing special ability, such as weighting, padding, or flares. Arrows are technically possible, but bundling them interferes with the bane effect. Runestaves are possible, but the undead bane effect will only come into play when the staff is physically used to strike something, rather than the user casting a spell.</p>

<p>Each dose of the flaring oils will last for 30 strikes before being used up, and the flares will occur with the same frequency as normal flares. Doses of weighting and padding will last for 10 strikes. When the oil is applied to weapons, a strike refers to that weapon hitting a creature or person. In the case of armor, a strike refers to the wearer being struck by something else.</p>

<p>Weapons with the oil will be able to hit undead without a bless, but a bless will extend the number of strikes a weapon can have before the oil is exhausted. Naturally holy (sanctified) items will increase the strikes to 75 for flares and 25 for weighting/padding. Items with a holy water bless, such as those obtained from a cleric with over 40 ranks in cleric spells, will see 60 strikes for flares and 20 for weighting/padding. Normal blesses will have 45 for flares and 15 for weighting/padding. Purifying the weapon before the bless will extend the number of hits by another 50% before the oil application fades.*</p>

<p>Semi-self charging idol info, stolen from another post, (credit to Zaigh for doing the math):</p>

<p>*The # of charges used before losing 1 to the max is = the current max. Taking that into account it makes the total charges a simple summation as shown below. First number is initial max charges, second number is total charges given the prior assumption. </p>

<p>11 - 66
12 - 78
14 - 105
16 - 136
17 - 153
18 - 171
20 - 210
22 - 253</p>
