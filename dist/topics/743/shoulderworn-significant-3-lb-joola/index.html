<p><strong>an illthorn-toggled amethyst silk purse overlain with veil iron mesh</strong>
<em>(an amethyst silk purse overlain with veil iron mesh studded with alexandrite shard rivets)</em>
Look description:
An open-weave mesh of veil iron has been lain over amethyst silk, the dark navy hue of the metal contrasted against the pale fabric. At the intersections of the mesh are socketed rivets, adding another layer of detail to the piece. An illthorn toggle inset with matching socketed inlay fastens the purse at the top, and a veil iron chain link strap serves to suspend the purse just above the wearer's hip. The amethyst silk purse has an empty socket that looks ready to have a gem pushed into the purse.
