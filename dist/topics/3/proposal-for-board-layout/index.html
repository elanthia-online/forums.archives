<p>I appreciate you assembling this list from the other forums, I think we can greatly collapse some of this, because tags should actually work here.</p>

<p>For instance you could have a <code>Professions</code> category and all discussions under that could get the relevant tag and it should be useful.  Still investigating.</p></div></article><article id="post-5" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">horibu</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, July 13th, 2017, 8:37:09 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Whatever we do... we should make sure to include Savants.

If we set up a proper group/topic/whatnot for use by Newsby, I think we'll be able to help with a lot of your efforts.  We can talk about it in more details as necessary in Discord.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
