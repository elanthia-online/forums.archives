<p>I'm going to try something in the very near future. If it gets a good turnout/response, I'll do more of it! Makes sense, right? Right.</p>

<p>Be on the lookout for a raffle in the Citizens' Lounge (in the Hog's Pen) in the next couple days (I'll post when it's set up, just need to zero in on a time). I'm looking at a ticket cost of 150k, or thereabout.</p>

<p>The prize will be 30 minutes one-on-one with a merchant. There will be no additional cost after that of the raffle ticket.</p>

<p>Available services will be:</p>

<p>General alters
Lighten/deepen
Feature alterations
Tattoos
Enchant unlocking (obviously wizards only)</p>

<p>This is basic stuff that any general merchant can do, but you'll essentially be the only one in line if you win. How much/many you can get is based on what fits into that 30 minutes, so being prepared in advance is highly recommended. Review ALTER in game for rules, have a list of things you'd like in case something doesn't fly, things like that.</p>

<p>I hope this sparks some interest for you guys, and I'll post the date of the raffle and drawing in the next few days!</p>

<p>This time, we'll redeem the same night, immediately following the drawing. My schedule is a little bit unpredictable right now, so I'm going to set the raffle almost 2 weeks out to buy tickets and come up with ideas in order to give you all time to prepare.</p>

<p>The raffle will draw on Thursday 9/28 at around 9pm ET. Expect the table to show up in the Hog's Pen, Citizens Lounge today.</p>

<p>I fully plan to offer this again if this is as well-received as it appears to be so far.</p>
