I didn't make this world for you.
You didn't buy any stock in my railroad.
You didn't invest in my corporation.
Where are your shares in standard oil?
I made the world for the rich
And the will-be-rich
And the have-always-been-rich.
Not for you,
Hungry Child.</p>

Just did a lengthy writeup on him for a term paper.  He had an amazing ability to pull maximum intensity out of minimal words... even though he was maybe a Communist (though probably not).</p>

<p>What happens to a dream deferred?</p>

<p>Does it dry up
      like a raisin in the sun?
      Or fester like a sore—
      And then run?
      Does it stink like rotten meat?
      Or crust and sugar over—
      like a syrupy sweet?</p>

<p>Maybe it just sags
      like a heavy load.</p>

<p>Or does it <strong><em>explode</em></strong>?</p></div></article></div></body></html>
