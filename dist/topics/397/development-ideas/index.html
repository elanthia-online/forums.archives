<li><p>Can SENSE be updated to show your current ensorcell energy?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we get some of tedium removed from scroll infusion?</p>

  <p>remove need to dip brushes in ink and clean them off - is this level of realism really necessary? </p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>or just remove the charges from runestones and you make one it lasts forever</p>
  
  <p>I stopped using this because of the massive hassle involved in it.  I don't think I've used this in quite a few years (I know its supposed to be uber powerful)</p>

<ul>
<li>702 infuses the target with phantom mana that makes 719 hit like it is a magical creature.  Demonology lore involved for the effect (its needs love)</li>

<p>Time to revisit the idea! Seems like a good fit for a Curse, to me. The mana cost would be not-insignificant, but would be worth it.</p></div></article><article id="post-3967" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Fromer</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 3:07:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Im not in favor of having scroll infusion revisited for selfish reasons.

Maybe I'm missing something, but I feel the need to run a script that constantly keeps 920 up in the background, even when I don't need a familiar. That's so I can avoid having to burn charges on a talisman for a full "resummon" if it drops completely. (Yes, I've made "backup" talismans so even if I do I won't lose that particular familiar, but can we at least make it so a talisman just has unlimited charges?)</p></div></article><article id="post-3981" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 30th, 2017, 6:19:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ponclast </p>

<p>This one is easy. Come to plat, you get a custom familiar thingie at 20 automatically. Problem Solved!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
