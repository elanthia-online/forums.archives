We are doing a <strong>Feast of the Immortals gift exchange</strong> (Secret Santa) in Platinum again this year!</p>

<p>The cutoff date to join is going to be <strong>OCTOBER 12th</strong>, the day BEFORE merchant week at Ebon Gate starts. That way everyone receives their intended recipient and has time to gift shop/design.</p>

I think something like this should be handled in-character as much as possible, and none that I RP would be suitable.</p></div></article><article id="post-6430" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, October 13th, 2017, 11:34:22 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@evarin ...

<p>No worries if you haven't found something yet. You still have over a month to think on a suitable gift for your match!</p>
