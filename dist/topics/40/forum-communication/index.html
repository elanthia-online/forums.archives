<p>Personal preference - Discord offers voice chat and is geared towards gamers. Slack is a "workplace productivity tool" (lol) that I can get away with using at the office. Both are miles better than AIM. I recommend tinkering with each of them and seeing which one you like better. Or, just get sucked into both like some of us have.</p></div></article><article id="post-1491" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Khariz</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 4:32:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>How do I get an invite to the GSIV Slack?</p></div></article><article id="post-1497" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ondreian</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, August 12th, 2017, 6:18:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>via my <a href="http://gemstone-iv-slackin.herokuapp.com/">invite server</a></p></div></article></div></body></html>
