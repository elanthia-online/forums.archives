I managed to make two perfect handaxes, that took a couple days, and some luck. Now I'm working on trying to make perfect longswords and the time it takes to craft the blades is even worse. With mithril taking 4 minutes a round, and the blade taking 5 rounds I'm only getting 3 done in an hour, this is going to take me forever.</p>

<p>One thing I thought of to maybe fix this a bit would be to come up with a system to lower the round time each time you make a perfect. What I mean by this is, if every time you make a perfect weapon, you knock off a percentage of the overall crafting time for that particular weapon. I was thinking if you take 5% off every time you make a perfect up to a maximum of a 50% reduction. So if you manage to make 10 perfects you would then be able to make that particular weapon 50% faster because you would be more of an expert crafting it since you already made 10 of them.</p>

<p>I don't know how more people haven't gone insane from this. Mad props to everyone that has done this.</p></div></article><article id="post-3867" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 29th, 2017, 4:38:13 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'm the way I am because of my forging character.
