My pure is trained for disarm specifically to prevent item loss.  Beginning with SoS 'updated' disarm, it seems I may be able to re-allocate those points soon if i'm only training to prevent an item loss mechanic.
Are there any proposals to change the player-version CMAN disarm we can expect, either offensive trickiness or defensive buffs to new disarm moves like the weapon-to-snake ability in SoS?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></div></article><article id="post-1749" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Khariz</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 14th, 2017, 2:53:32 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There is a disarm review under foot according to posts on the Officials.
