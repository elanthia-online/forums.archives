<p>I'm starting this thread to go along with the new Merchant Feedback. We have an opportunity to put some nice systems in place so I think it would be good to solicit feedback.</p>

<p>So the current tag setup forces us to use "new posts" instead of a single large consolidated thread like the PCForums.  After thinking about it... I actually like this BETTER.  900+ posts in a single thread was pointless and you ended up searching it anyways.  Now we can have 900+ posts in this folder with TAGS and other searchable features.  Let me know what you guys think!</p>

<p>Currently we have trust/shady tags setup, but we can implement a lot more of these kinds of things.</p>

<p>For example... <br />
1. Silver tags for silver transactions
2. auction tags for auctions</p>

<p>Please feel free to discuss and add any suggestions.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
