<p>I predict we will start to amass a considerable sum of Bloodscrip, Tickets or what have you on our characters. I was hoping if there would be a way for us to redeem these tickets for storage purposes and unredeem them into physical tickets for exchange purposes with other players. If there is already a method to do this then disregard. Thank you so much for all your hard work!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Tim</p></div></article><article id="post-350" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 12:03:49 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>There is already a method in the leather pouches that are available.

<p>You heard it here first, Sacru wants to exchange his premium points into blood scrip.</p>

<p>I think twisting words like that makes me ready to be a GM now.</p></div></article><article id="post-607" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 1:46:24 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin touch√©...</p></div></article><article id="post-612" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 2:08:58 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Whirlin In all seriousness, though... When I initially read the title, had assumed we were talking about a different type of exchange.

<p>Would be nice if we had a system for this in place like a currency exchange. Why have so many currencies if none of them can be converted? Liquidity could foster trust, and trust boosts markets. Fear generally does the opposite. Even irrational fear. I realize the idea of these paid events is to start forcing people to A) work for their currency, in a time-limited setting, increasing the mania factor, boosting general interest, or B) pay 2-3x as much to have someone else do it for you, versus C) silver-mining, which pays about $6/hr if you're not AFK scripting.</p>

<p>As I said -- totally selfish request. Just wondering if there will ever be a way to effectively convert these various currencies using some in-game mechanic.</p></div></article><article id="post-617" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Alastir</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 2:38:40 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sacru said in <a href="/post/612">Tickets Exchange</a>:</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but that is a prime example of why conversions shouldn't be allowed - At least when it comes to bloodscrip.</p>

<p>I see your point. And it's not going to happen in either case, when a secondary (i.e. organic, ungoverned) market exists for exactly such transactions or conversions. </p>

<p>They are the aptly named general tickets.</p>

<p>Wyrom has confirmed that they are discussing conversion.  At least something will be proposed.  I would not be surprised if anything can become general.  I'd be surprised if general can become much, and definitely not bloodscrip.</p></div></article><article id="post-722" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sacru</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 5:34:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@archsenex said in <a href="/post/705">Tickets Exchange</a>:</p>

<p>One would think this would make them more valuable, not less. Could be an awareness issue, which I'm fine with. I will sit on these for now, and hope to put them to good use.</p>

<p>This makes logical sense. Begs the question, is DR -- and bloodscrip specifically -- being segregated entirely from that process in order to manage supply/demand? Do you envision a day where general tickets are accepted 1:1 in place of bloodscrip at DR?</p></div></article><article id="post-741" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 5:55:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sacru said in <a href="/post/722">Tickets Exchange</a>:</p>

<p>Probably not.  At duskruin, bloodscrip is the prize.  At other venues, tickets are a consolation prize, they aren't the jackpot.  You can't get a DR jackpot, after all.</p>

<p>They're different scales.  Shells, however, will ALSO be a consolation, not the prize, so I see them swapping as making more sense.</p></div></article><article id="post-744" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 6:06:10 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The only time swapping makes sense to me is when one of these alt-currencies is largely obsolete.

<p>What happens to DR prices when every character is sitting on 100k bloodscrip?  Are the things offered now for 10k, going to be priced at 100k to offset the banking of the BS?  What if only a few people bank several million in bloodscrip?  Does that limit your ability to offer high end things because you'd have to price them at 750k bloodscrip to prevent someone from amassing too many of the "powerful" offerings?</p></div></article><article id="post-754" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 6:15:18 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@alastir I agree with what you're saying as well.  Granted, we have that challenge with silvers, and it is mostly dealt with by limiting the number of items a person can purchase at a given event, but there's an added customer service question when you create an alt-currency to get customers to buy simucoins.. and then tell them they can't use the same alt-currency.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
