<p>Would you ever consider to allow spell abosrbing/bazz gloves to absorb charges from X/day rechargeable items (like the ones recently sold at DR for example)? That would be so damn cool. I realize it might be too hard to code for the effort. But hey, you never know until you ask.</p></div></article><article id="post-4377" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Mogonis</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 5:32:15 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Tamuz posted that the gloves disallow the wands, and it seems intentional.</p></div></article><article id="post-4378" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 5:34:49 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I tried that when they came out, with a 130 wand (not x per day though) I usually have merchants recharge.</p>

<p>That is correct it would be amazing and fun as hell. It would make the gloves so uber, and the wands amazing as well. Still not quite sure what would be so wrong about that? Sapping the charges from your wand would fill your gloves, and gloves wouldnt be refillable again until empty. So affectively you could store up 40 charges from a 20charge wand. I guess that is a problem...?</p>

<p>If it is "too powerful", it could be a t3 auction unlock on the gloves...but i guess thats probably asking too much.</p>

<p>I knew it was wishful thinking.</p></div></article><article id="post-4382" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 6:11:29 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@nocturnix </p>

<p>Basically, it allows you to ghetto clone the 20x items.  Not hunting one day?  Duplicate the item.  Also, it let's you start the recharge timer immediately, rather than once you start a hunt etc. </p>

<p>More likely they would let you convert your 20x into gloves.</p>

<p>Making it a high level unlock, maybe.  But it's very auction tier.</p></div></article><article id="post-4383" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kragdruk</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, 6:21:58 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Regardless of the power level, I suspect that making this work correctly would require complicated changes to the glove script as well as the x/day scripts.</p></div></article><article id="post-4430" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">darconas</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 9:04:48 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Does the gloves only eat wands/rods or can it eat other imbeddables like pins and the line?</p></div></article><article id="post-4452" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Roblar</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 11:21:56 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Wands or rods</p></div></article><article id="post-4468" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">allereli</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, September 6th, 2017, 2:40:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@darconas said in <a href="/post/4430">X/day wands + Spell eating gloves compatability.</a>:</p>

<p>unscripted wave/raise items. Like the MRs in the Loot Cellar work great with the gloves. You can clench to drain and then charge the MR again</p>
