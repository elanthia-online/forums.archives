<p>I don't <em>need</em> to buy anything, but I am about to have my twentieth training and I want to celebrate by getting a nice, functional something. The best equipment I have now are some 4x/1x leathers, which is fairly sad. So long story long, what would be the best investment of my paltry 8m; a runestaff of some sort? Some enchanted leathers? Some enhancive trinket?</p></div></article><article id="post-423" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 4:52:32 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>What area do you feel you are lacking in?

A logic enhancive is always a plus, as earning more XP is useful for a long time.</p></div></article><article id="post-425" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 5:06:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'd veto enhancives.  They're cheap, but even needing to worry about upkeeping them is an adminstrative hassle.</p>

<p>A nice runestaff?  ehh... 8m can get you something nice.  But, you can pretty much for free make something with 411, or a 4x flaring runestaff will only run you super cheap as it's basically the same thing.</p>

<p>Armor, 8m won't get you much either.</p>

<p>Honestly, my recommendation would be to wait until 25, and then start playing around with enchanting up your own set of gear to 7x (armor first).  You can invest some time in seeking lightening for them while they're tempering/whatnot.  If you want to save up 20m or so for a nervestaff, or some greater flaring runestaff, or something along with that nature, than go for it.  Or just any good deals that you identify. </p>

<p>If it's really burning a hole in your pocket, get a nice, maxlight, scripted, altered container of sorts with enough utility and space for the foreseeable future.  As a wizard, you'll be able to enchant up a lot of your own stuff for much cheaper over time.</p></div></article><article id="post-428" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Morardre</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 5:10:24 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim At this point I don't feel that I am lacking in any specific area (aside from a defense against Arch Wight's Earthen Fury), but I do lack having a cool item.

<p>I think it's that neat has moved more than anything else, and that neat Runestaffs are very pricey (lotta pures, after all)</p>

<p>8m is still enough to find something 7x etc.  But it isn't considered neat unless it's in the 30m category.  Still mechanically good.</p></div></article><article id="post-433" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 5:27:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I'd find a neat staff, low enchant with a fluff script or something and make it a project piece. The first things I did when starting up was to identify the things that I really enjoyed and started working on how to get them and then make them mechanically powerful. 
I'm also a much bigger fluff man than mechanical guy, but I have a few nice items.</p></div></article><article id="post-436" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Morardre</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 5:32:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@ordim I like that idea too.

There is some 4x temp crit padded full leather on there for 2m which is a bit pricey but you may find other armor or runestaffs there that might be useful at a good price.

You won't be able to buy items directly with silvers, but you will be able to buy the Duskruin currency (bloodscrip) for silvers from other players, and use that currency to buy something nice at the festival.</p>

<p>Crit Padded armor is an amazing item for Pures, but you might be able to get a 5x runestaff with 4x Acuity flares and T4 Nervestaff flares from DR if you play the market a bit on Bloodscrip.  They sell for 10,000 bloodscrip (I believe), and are fantastic for any caster.  Plus, it gives you the fun task of attuning to the runestaff, so you can unlock the full power of Nervestaff flares.</p></div></article><article id="post-735" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">peam</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 9th, 2017, 5:47:42 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I think you've gotten a pretty wide array of advice here and it's all pretty good.  A lot of what you spend on is going to come down to personal taste/wants.</p>

<p>I'm running a bolting/bane cleric who is upper-30s at the moment.  I'm planning on riding my 4x/1x acuity/1x ensorcell runestaff to cap.  The only reason I'm riding that and not my old 5x staff is because the current one is unlocked and I can slap PCs with it.</p>

<p>Same thing with armor.  I'm running around in 5x robes.  I'll probably bite the bullet and jump over to leathers at some point.</p>

<p>I'm rambling.</p>

<p>In short, I'm not planning on buying nice gear until I cap.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
