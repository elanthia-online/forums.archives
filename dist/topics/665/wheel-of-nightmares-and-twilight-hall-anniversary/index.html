You give the roulette wheel within the quartz stone credenza a spin, which causes the silver ball to roll around the outer ring of the wheel.  As the roulette wheel begins slowing down, the silver ball clangs over several numbered slots.  Once the wheel comes to a stop, the ball settles on zero.
Roundtime: 2 sec.
R&gt;recite zero, higher or lower?
You recite:

  "Zero, higher or lower?"

Ordim exclaims, "Higher!"
Ordim lets out a cheer!

Hazado laughs!
You give the roulette wheel within the quartz stone credenza a spin, which causes the silver ball to roll around the outer ring of the wheel.  As the roulette wheel begins slowing down, the silver ball clangs over several numbered slots.  Once the wheel comes to a stop, the ball settles on double zero.
Roundtime: 2 sec.
Ordim gasps.
&gt;gasp
You gasp.
Nyatherra begins chuckling at Ordim!
Beldannon quietly says, "Wow."
Ordim's jaw drops.
A pained expression crosses Inniro's face.
Beldannon chuckles.

Roblar releases a slow, low whistle.
The sentry shifts her position slightly as she watches people come and go.
Roblar rubs Ordim.
Ordim giggles.
