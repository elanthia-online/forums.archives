With the reported updates to weighting/padding, I was curious if there will be an update to 735 working better on these items, specifically those super duty items like claidhmores or other items that require ridiculous amounts of training in 700 spell circle.  Currently, it can be damn near impossible to do these items, and with it being announced that no merchants offering ensorcell work ever again, it is a rather important question to ask.</p>

<p>No, there will not be any changes to ensorcelling weighted/padded items. The items that are difficult/impossible are by design.</p>

<p>No, as already stated. That will never be offered as a future merchant service. Not all items are intended to be ensorcelled, especially if they already have a number of high end properties.</p>

<p>Not sure if it still does but voln armor analyze talked about added X points to your armor's gear score.</p></div></article><article id="post-1619" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 3:49:01 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@evarin So another thing we got a peek of behind the curtain is that items apparently have what I'm going to call "power scores" and not even Duskruin Certs can get beyond the "power score" limits that dev/whoever has set. Incredibly powerful weapons/armors were turned down from some otherwise simple services because it exceeded that "power score" limit. That might be one part of it.</p>

<p>There are many instances where a player can do something to a weapon easily that makes it no longer enchantable. There are many services that then allow a merchant or service to further enchant it. There are very few things a player can do to make an item no longer ensorcable until you are talking about the top end of items. I think you are exactly proving my point, everyone outside of the GMs/Devs are saying "but you can just do this, so why not just do it for us and save us the jumping through hoops?".</p>

<p>I'd rather see players be able to enchant anything that PPs and merchants can and give sorc's whatever buff is needed to at least let the best of the best on the best roll ensorcell the best items.</p></div></article><article id="post-1649" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 13th, 2017, 5:48:54 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>If they're using some some of power score on gear they should make that clear to players.

Sorcs that don't maintain the skills have the requirement to fixskill to do top end jobs at the sacrifice of other skills. Which of course they try to pass on the cost to their prey.. I mean customers, or  aren't willing to do this. I applaud Estlid's response given the already unbalanced silver flow into the hands of sorcs. You want to get T5 on an MCP+ or MCW+  item, you're going to need the skills. As was pointed out, planning an item from the start will help, I did T5 on a couple of projects first and then enchanted, which either made the enchanting much harder or put that extra sting in Sadie point acquisition cost (a real limiter).</p></div></article><article id="post-2185" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Destrier</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 18th, 2017, 8:31:37 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Might not be an issue for most.  But with rangers only being able to single SMC training.  Resist Nature.  Not all of us have SMC enhancives to get to 136 ranks.</p>

<p>Training in Spiritual Mana Control adds to the duration of the applied resistance. It also allows the spell to be cast on damage or crit padded armor, based on a seed 1 summation of ranks. It is possible to add resistance to "lightly" padded armor beginning at 1 rank, "very heavily" at 91 ranks, and the lowest level of "masterfully" padded armor at 136 enhanced ranks.</p>

<p>How about a game mechanic (ensorcelling) that does:</p>

<ol>
<li>Designed to feed silvers into sorc pockets.</li>
<li>Sorcs aren't going to attempt hard projects without generally passing their energy cost to the customer.</li>
<li>The overall system creates an eternal revenue source for sorcs of millions of silver and a game mechanic which ensures people will pay.</li>
<li>And the best part. Their energy is free just for hunting lmao.</li>

<p>LOL Worse than any rogue has ever done.</p>
