Most skins can be provided up to level 60, though rates will be discounted if they are given to me. Certain gems can be requested, but if I do not have them in my inventory, you will need to provide them. You can view a list of approved dyes on the <a href="https://gswiki.play.net/Sheath_making#Dyes_.28Decoration.29">GSWiki page</a>, or you request a custom dye that is not listed, through it will increase turnaround time for delivery.</p>

<p>Pricing will start at 50k (base service, no dyes/adornments, you provide skins) and go up based on requested features.</p>

<p>As an addendum:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I provide the skins, the surcharge will be 3x the maximum appraised value of the skin. This is for the main harness and fringe, if requested. If leather or lacquer cures are requested, I will use the lowest level creature skin type available as creature type is not preserved in the process.</p></li>
<li><p>If I provide the gems, there will be a  surcharge of 3x the maximum appraised value of each gem.  This is on top of the required 50 silver per gem for the settings.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, I'd do it for the right price.  If it's still plausible... it's worth a shot to see.  Do you recall which Krol tended to scalp. I don't think all of them do.</p></div></article><article id="post-5682" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">archigeek</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 29th, 2017, 8:41:14 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>They were a reskin of at the WL event, so I don't know.</p></div></article><article id="post-5683" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maetriks</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, September 29th, 2017, 9:01:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Yeah, it's been a while since I hunted in RR...
