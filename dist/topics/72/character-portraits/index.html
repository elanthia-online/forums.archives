<p>Recent work shown as it's completed in posts below in this thread.</p>

<p>F.A.Q.</p>

<p>Q. How much duckets?
A. Between 30 and 100 depending on your need (or equivalent in silver).</p>

<p>Q. Will you make this thing specifically for me?
A. No. I have an incredibly extensive library of models and textures ready to go. They take a long, long time to make from scratch, and not everything in my library was made by me. Modeling takes enough time that it's not monetarily worthwhile for me to model anything for you, nor you to pay for that. That said, my library is very extensive, so I am confident I have enough that you'll like.</p>

<p>Q. How do you decide on the price?
A. I'm completely transparent here. I charge $30 an hour for my services for my business. I expect to spend around 4 hours on your job if I quote you $100. I will spend more than 4 hours on your job for $100 when all is said and done, but that's the price I quote. If I think your job is going to be very simple, I'll quote less. I'll never charge you at the end more than I quote, unless you request something that would up the quote. If you do request such a thing, I'll warn you that it'll cost more for me to do before I do it.</p>

<p>Q. Will you re-texture that item from your proof?
A. Maybe. If it's a simple change. If it's a wide sweeping change, probably not. There's not just a texture to worry about. I also have to normal map, specular map, and re-light everything properly.</p>

<p>Q. I like that item from your proof, but could you make it X colored?
A. Yeah. No problem. That's a setting I can tweak easily.</p>

<p>Q. I like that leather bodice from your proof, but I'd rather it was satin and shiny. Can you do that?
A. Yeah, probably. I have a large library of materials to work with.</p>

<p>Q. My character's hair doesn't look exactly like your proof shows.
A. Sorry. This one's the hardest one for me to change. I have a large library and can show you several options, but the chances of me making changes aside from color, specularity and glossiness to hair are slim to none. I can in most cases work with the bones of the hair though and move it around to position it differently. Hair styling is a possibility within limits.</p>

<p>What if I pay you and you never produce a product, or I don't like it?
A. I don't take payment until the job is finished and you have the finished files. If you don't like them, don't pay for them. I'm not in the business of charging people for work they aren't happy with.</p>

<p>Q. How does it work?
A. You give me a description of your character, and if you have any specific requests for lighting or anything out of the norm (i.e. - I'd like my character cloaked partially in darkness because I am a twilight vampire and do not want my portrait too sparkly). I will create you a proof to look at. You'll let me know if you want any changes, or would like to see different hair styles, clothing, weapons, et cetera. I'll make up to 3 significant revisions on a given project. If at the end, you're not happy with it, just don't pay for it. If you are happy with the result, pay for it. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>If you got through all that and would be interested in a character portrait, send me a PM or email me at clippincott@labreesbakery.com.</p>

<p>Pretty sure the hedgehog IS nude, and since Daz can do morph blending, it probably has genitals. If not, they are available somewhere.</p>

<p>Or there's always the site to buy that stuff.  I won't link it because some people have weak stomachs.</p></div></article><article id="post-973" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author"></div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 6:20:49 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>You can request NSFW stuff popups and whatnots to be added.

<p>Short answer: Yes. Even when not requested.</p>

<p>Long answer: Obviously.  The trick is, get people to think I'm doing regular portraits by posting a lot of regular portraits. That way you get accurate descriptions of all the characters. Then you just make them naked instead of putting clothes on them. </p>

<p>In reality however: Still yes, when requested. The idea for me doing portraits in the first place came from people requesting horrendous sex acts to be drawn from my deviantart portfolio, so any nudery I might do here is tame compared to the things I get requested there.</p></div></article><article id="post-1026" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">HJFudge</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 8:33:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I both Do and Do Not want to see your deviantart portfolio now</p></div></article><article id="post-1027" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 10th, 2017, 8:34:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>And on Archsenex's comment...yes.

<p>You probably have if you have prurient interests. And let's not kid ourselves, who doesn't? My deviantart account is actually about 15 deviantart accounts, all tailored to specific interests to garner commissions.</p>

<p>Also, for example of tasteful nude mentioned earlier:</p>

<p>Also also, for because I can't NOT post it when nude portraits are mentioned, here is what the normal map of a donger looks like when you flatten it out. Mostly SFW, but making it a link instead of an embed just in case.</p>
