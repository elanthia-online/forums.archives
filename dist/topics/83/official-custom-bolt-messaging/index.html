For example, when a wizard normally casts Major Fire (908), this is what they see:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>incant 908
  Your hands glow with power as you invoke the phrase for Major Fire...
  Your spell is ready.
  You gesture at a giant rat.
  You hurl a roaring ball of fire at a giant rat!
  AS: +12 vs DS: -27 with AvD: +70 + d100 roll: +78 = +187
  ... and hit for 60 points of damage!
  Extreme heat causes a giant rat's right leg to expand and snap. That must hurt!
  The giant rat is stunned!
  The roaring ball of fire strikes a giant rat, blossoming into a much larger sphere of flame upon impact.
  ... 45 points of damage!
  Left leg completely charred.
  Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With custom bolt messaging, they can change the verb and the object that is thrown. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>incant 908
  Your hands glow with power as you invoke the phrase for Major Fire...
  Your spell is ready.
  You gesture at a giant rat.
  You conjure a sizzling red hot fireball at a giant rat!
  AS: +12 vs DS: -27 with AvD: +70 + d100 roll: +78 = +187
  ... and hit for 60 points of damage!
  Extreme heat causes a giant rat's right leg to expand and snap. That must hurt!
  The giant rat is stunned!
  The roaring ball of fire strikes a giant rat, blossoming into a much larger sphere of flame upon impact.
  ... 45 points of damage!
  Left leg completely charred.
  Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are able to customize the verb and the object that is thrown. e.g. hurl, toss, throw, fling, breathe, exhale, direct. All 20 bolt spells in the game can individually be customized:</p>

<p>111: Fire Spirit Bolt
118: Web
306: Holy Bolt
505: Hand of Tonis
510: Hurl Boulder
518: Cone of Elements, Major Air Bolt
705: Disintegrate
713: Balefire
901: Minor Shock
903: Minor Water
904: Minor Acid
906: Minor Fire
907: Major Cold
908: Major Fire
910: Major Shock
1100: Empathic Assault
1700: Arcane Blast Bolt
1707: Minor Steam
1709: Minor Cold
1710: Major Acid</p>

<p>Cone of Elements (518) actually casts the individual bolt spell at each target, so if a wizard customizes Minor Fire (906), then casts 518 with fire, it will use the custom 906 messaging. Major Air Bolt doesn't exist as an individual spell, but it can still be customized for 518.</p>

<p>This logic (in terms of differentiating player options) could be applied to pretty much any RPG.  Most games only have so many ways to illustrate an idea.  So even though there are a handful of spells that all deal fire damage, they still need to look and feel different.  In a text based game, we're obviously a lot more limited to text and thus synonyms, but overall, the concept isn't unique to GemStone.</p></div></article><article id="post-1875" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 15th, 2017, 3:01:58 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@estild said in <a href="/post/1872">Official: Custom Bolt Messaging</a>:</p>
