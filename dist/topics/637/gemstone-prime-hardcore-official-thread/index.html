Voln seems like it would have better longterm benefits (plan to hunt a good amount of undead already +reim), but CoL would offer a quick AS/DS boost.

<ol>
<li><p>In a little over one week since going live, we now have over 30 active HARDCORE participants in the competition. My sincere thanks to everyone who decided to join in on the fun.</p></li>
<li><p>The leaderboards have been significantly updated on the wiki and on each unofficial message board. Along with the standard Title/Level and Society achievements, Guild Skill, Artisan Skill, Locksmithing, and Adventurer Guild skills have also been added. In the near future I will announce prizes for some of these achievements, so be on the lookout!</p></li>
<li><p>Two new rule changes have been drafted and will go into effect tomorrow (November 9th 2017) should there be no issues that arise after being reviewed by the HARDCORE community. Please see below and feel free to comment should you have questions, concerns, or suggestions. Note that these points are largely for clarification purposes and should not have an impact on your current method of playing.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>HARDCORE characters may perform services for non-HARDCORE characters such as (but not limited to) Healing, Locksmithing, Spellups, Loresinging, Blessing, Armor Adjustment, Scroll Infusion, Enchanting, and Ensorcelling. However, the HARDCORE character may not receive any reward or payment for said service outside of those provided by the game itself (Experience, Guild Reps, etc). These services cannot be provided to an alternate account of the player (AKA MAing) and should not be abused solely to earn "safe" experience.</p>
  
  <p>HARDCORE characters are not permitted to take part in pay festivals where real life currency is exchanged for a ticket such as Ebon Gate. Festivals that are free to all are permitted.  The exception to this rule is if a HARDCORE character wins entry to a pay festival via in-game means such as finding a ticket in the treasure system. Should this occur, the participant must announce his win in an appropriate thread (See links at end of wiki page) in the interest of full disclosure. </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>A player has suggested tracking original HARDCORE characters run by players who have yet to die during competition and marking them in the logs with an asterisk (*). This would provide a small bit of recognition for the longest running characters in the competition. An alternative option would be to provide a date of inception for each character to serve a similar purpose. If you have an opinion on the matter, please speak out and it will be taken into consideration moving forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, you may use a HARDCORE character to perform services including resurrections and spellups for non-HARDCORE characters, including your own.</p></div></article><article id="post-7558" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 19th, 2017, 12:28:31 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>A number of rules have either been added or further clarified. </p>

<p>HARDCORE characters may reroll <em>prior</em> to dying and keep their current name should they wish to do so. Aftering rerolling, new level, race, and profession information should be conveyed via updating the wiki or in a message board post in the appropriate thread.</p>

<p>Should a HARDCORE character receive outside spells from another player, they may dispel themselves using any available means to include an alternate account, fellow HARDCORE characters, or non-HARDCORE characters.</p>

<p>Items and silver may not be obtained from other characters. This means nothing may be received from another character or player shop, including character-to-character sales. All silver and inventory must be earned by the HARDCORE character. NPC shop purchases are permitted. Items the HARDCORE character obtained from a merchant, including raffles and merchant services, are permitted. Use of the pawnshop is allowed. However, no attempts should be made to knowingly buy or sell items to purposefully supply HARDCORE characters.</p>

<p>GemStone IV Prime HARDCORE characters shall at a minimum toggle on the ability to view their level in their profiles. It is recommended that the Strongest Foe toggle also be set, as well as any other appplicable toggles such as Warcamps, Lock, Trap, Guild, and Society.</p>

<p>Participation in Societies, to include tasks requiring the direct involvement of other characters is permitted, as is the use of both HARDCORE and Non-HARDCORE characters to complete said tasks. MAing the required participants is not permitted, nor is use of non-HARDCORE characters to make certain tasks easier, such as razing warcamps.</p>

<p>Also, it is important to remember that should your HARDCORE character die, you MUST either delete said character or reroll into a different name. Keeping the same name upon death creates a number of complications that are best avoided.</p></div></article><article id="post-7568" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 20th, 2017, 7:19:59 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Gazlock is out.

Participation in games or competitions run by CHE/MHOs, groups, or individuals are allowed only if the chance of success is not guaranteed. The HARDCORE character may not receive spells, services, or hunt in groups with NON-HARDCORE characters during the course of these games.

</blockquote>

<p>The point of the competition is to have dire consequences associated with character death. Strip the competition of said consequences and it fails to have a point. As has been mentioned before, there is no system in place that forces you to delete the character. However, as you are agreeing to the rules of the competition when you sign up, violating them would mean subsequent characters would not be considered as actual participants. </p>

<p>None of this is official, however. There's nothing stopping someone from breaking all the rules of the competition and claiming they are still a participant. Since its inception, no one has attempted any sort of disruptive behavior, but it's simply a matter of time before someone tries to do so. The situation will be dealt with as best as possible when and if the need arises.</p></div></article><article id="post-7683" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">OldSkool</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, November 30th, 2017, 11:36:12 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Actually, considering this is prime, I am very, very impressed with everyone's behavior.

<p>I did a brief Q&amp;A with people on the Lnet HARDCORE channel the other day brainstorming for ideas regarding a HC MHO. As mentioned before, a big perk would be to provide an IC explanation of why those in the group choose to play the way we do. That has already been discussed, though.</p>

<p>The other big point was to be able to provide the HC community with chances to exchange goods/services that would otherwise be against the rules or unavailable. There seemed to be general consensus that as long as there weren't just events that were excuses to spell each other up that people would be interested in joining and wouldn't see it as a gross violation of the spirit of the HARDCORE competition.</p>

<p>Group hunts would be one idea for events, but i'd also like to see swap meets, limited sales between HC characters, raffles/games/competitions for items that wouldn't normally be available due to being from pay festivals, etc. </p>

<p>Membership would have to be available to everyone so that no one would see the MHO as an unfair advantage or perk. I'd also like to see more input from HC folks to allow people to weigh in with their opinions on what they'd like to see from the group.</p></div></article><article id="post-7720" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, December 4th, 2017, 2:05:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@evarin banleus lvl 0 bard!!</p></div></article><article id="post-7722" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, December 4th, 2017, 2:26:25 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@losus said in <a href="/post/7720">Gemstone PRIME HARDCORE Official Thread</a>:</p>

We've had a number of additions to the roster, though some of them didn't quite stick. Both Mimia and Irneya tried their Dark Elvish hands at Sorcery and met their fates at the hands of a Kobold Shepherd and Large Ogre respectively. Apparently, Ogres aren't fond of people running through their turf on the way to Solhaven. The newcomers who survived the weekend were Sundamar, a Bard chasing after the top slot, the Sorcerer Sutudo, Mirda representing the Paladins, and Bowltar and Mazakeen round out the Wizards. This will be the seventh of the Maza clan, with Mazikeene struck down by an unknown foe. </p>

<p>Other deaths include Viserys who apparently slipped through the cracks and perished some time ago. Thorndis, a promising Rogue met his end via a Tree Viper on a treck back from joining Sunfist. Finally, brave Orwac made the bold but unwise decision to try a solo Reim hunt and met his end via an Ethereal Traveller. </p>

<p>That'll do it for this update.

<p>Locksmithing - HARDCORE characters are permitted to open the boxes of other HARDCORE characters. The HARDCORE locksmith may not accept rewards for their efforts beyond the experience gained. Scarabs and trap components are considered the property of the locksmith. As mentioned elsewhere, HARDCORE locksmiths may also offer their services to non-HARDCORE clients as well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Group Hunting - In order to promote group hunting, the restrictions on aiding your fellow competitors has been modified to allow the use of the following (Self-cast or item cast) spells:  Stun Relief (108), Undisease (113), Unpoison (114), Spirit Guide (130), Calm (201), Untrammel (209), Minor Sanctuary (213), Major Sanctuary (220), Breeze (612), Celerity (506) [Group effect only], Traveler's Song (1020), Troubadour's Rally (1040), Adrenal Surge (1107), and Soothing Word (1202). In addition, it is permitted to drag your hunting partner to safety, or to execute them if there is risk of your partner(s) dying in battle (Deaths from CvC do not count towards elimination). Note that this list is in addition to the other spells allowed during group hunting, not in replacement thereof.</p></div></article><article id="post-7810" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, December 11th, 2017, 6:50:24 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Evarin </p>

<p>so two things...</p>

<p>First - Ryogo the F2P Empath has stepped in the ring but in no way will I be climbing up the charts but I will be competing just super slow.</p>

<p>Second - not sure how I feel about the part about executing a fellow HC member to avoid death.  I am cool with dragging but to me Executing a fellow member just seems like a way of purposely circumventing the permadeath.  It is no different IMO than rolling the dice and logging off after that 10 round stun and hoping to god that the creature doesn't return from the fray.  There may have been a vote on it and I missed it but that is just me.  I won't do it, but I if need be can find a way to deal if others can.</p></div></article><article id="post-7811" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kaldonis</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, December 11th, 2017, 8:35:04 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Not sure if Miracle (350) is allowed, but I'd rather see that than trying to kill each other.</p>

<p>My wife Sarah and I decided to give hardcore a go yesterday.  </p>

<p>I had read the wiki, and a few forum posts but not much.  She didn't read anything.  Some topics we discussed; for instance we had reasoned Unstun with a hunting partner (has to be hardcore) seemed reasonably okay to our judgement.  </p>

<p>We went for a pair of sorcerers on the basis that sorcerers probably don't care about not being shared with and that illusions are free experience for all.  (We both have a sorcerer guild master, though we won't ever MA it.)</p>

<p>On that, our basic agreement was to keep them both the same level basically, so if one dies then the other should reasonably pause.  Sarah joked that as long as I keep killing myself quickly, it's the only way we can stay the same level, anyway.</p>

<p>I'm now a brawling sorcerer, with 100 Agility, in Voln (it sounds safer), hiding behind an imflass aegis I bought at the pawnshop.</p></div></article><article id="post-7814" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Kaldonis</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, December 11th, 2017, 9:09:11 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Oh this is just pitiful.

<p>For the record, I've never played a bard before.</p>

<p>I just saw the low-hanging fruit (bard levels), most likely cause of death (low level melee encounter), and chose an Elf and put Agility at 100.  With a natural +40 DS I figured, I think I can do better than level 6.

<p>Inventory: 
You are wearing a vaalorn augmented breastplate, some heavy wolf skin handwraps, an exquisite gold ring, a brushed pewter circlet, a glacial white smooth glaes armband, a pair of white ora-buttoned breeches, a pair of white oilskin boots, a grey wolf hide cloak, a metal-linked wolf hide sporran, a steel bound lacquered swordbelt trimmed with veniom, and a polished fireleaf aegis.</p>

<p>Death Log:
[Smuggling Tunnels, Storage]
Several tall bolts of cloth lean in the corners, carefully tied about the middle.  The crimsons and azures have long since faded into ruin, and the dust makes them unrecoverable, but they do serve to speak of the prosperity of this smuggling operation.  A stack of hides stands next to them, looking ugly beside the elegant material.  You also see a wraith.

   Blow raises a welt on your right arm.
The subdued warmth embracing you fades along with the spiritual force surrounding your arms.
You lose a bit of focus as the knowledge of future battles drifts from your mind.

Your skin grows slightly numb for a moment as the warm glow fades from around you.
The dully illuminated mantle protecting you begins to falter, then completely fades away.
Your boosted confidence and fearlessness fade.
You feel the extra courage wane.
The light blue glow leaves you.</p>

<p>It seems you have died, my friend.  Although you cannot do anything, you are keenly aware of what is going on around you...</p>

<p>You mentally give a sigh of relief as you remember that the Goddess Lorminstra owes you a favor.</p>

<p>No entry would be complete without a death in the Maza clan, and this week is no exception. Mazakean lost her life at the hands of a Bone Golem at level 13, but was quickly replaced by Mazakeene, 9th of her line. Other newcomers include Kabah, a Human Bard moving up the ranks, Trostam the Paladin, Nishe the Elf Wizard, and Ainumorco the Elf Paladin.</p>

<p>Both Ainumorco and Mazakeene are entrants into the first HARDCORE seasonal competition which runs until the 31st. There's plenty of time to enter and plenty of silver to be made, so sign up if you have the itch. </p>

<p>REMOVED: ~~In addition, it is permitted to drag your hunting partner to safety, or to execute them if there is risk of your partner(s) dying in battle (Deaths from CvC do not count towards elimination).~~</p>

<p>ADDED: PvP deaths in HARDCORE typically do not eliminate a competitor assuming the act was not done in an effort to avoid death via standard game mechanics. Player deaths that DO NOT cause elimination include CvC (in-character conflicts), deaths via fumbled traps (HARDCORE locksmith deaths are considered a legitimate elimination), and accidental non-HARDCORE player deaths in town or afield. Examples include getting caught in someone’s Major E-wave or Nature’s Fury while traveling. Death at the hands of your HARDCORE hunting partner(s) is considered a legitimate elimination, accidental or otherwise.</p>

<p>Summary: Due to competitor feedback, rules regarding PvP deaths have been amended to disallow killing a fellow competitor to aid him in avoiding elimination. The rules regarding PvP have also been clarified.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to KEEP the rules the same, please say so. If you would like to CHANGE the rules, please state that instead. Feel free to state how you think they should be changed, but remember to either vote to KEEP or CHANGE the rules.</p>

<p>I'll track votes until 11:59 PM EST this Sunday.</p>

<p><strong><em>To have your vote counted, please vote in the HARDCORE Discord channel. Otherwise, it may not be properly tracked.</em></strong> </p>

<p>If you need help accessing the Discord, let me know and we'll figure it out.</p></div></article><article id="post-8302" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, January 20th, 2018, 7:45:33 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Evarin </p>

A vote was held to decide whether or not the rule regarding disqualification for failing to delete a fallen character should be changed. The results of the vote are in, 10 votes to keep the rules as they stand now, and 4 votes to change them. As such, the rule will stand that you must delete/reroll your HARDCORE character should they die during competition if you wish to enter a new one. Failure to do so will result in any future characters not being recognized as HARDCORE. </p>

<p>However, allowences have been made so that characters wishing to exempt their characters from deletion prior to dying can instead choose to RETIRE said character.  Retirement removes the character from the competition, but leaves the player free to enter a new character in their stead. To be clear, the decision to retire a HARDCORE character must be made BEFORE their death, and is irreversible. The wiki will be updated with guidance on this issue before the end of the day. Speaking of retirement, Yimo, Chauvech, and Durie have all decided to hang up their hats and exit from the competition while still among the living. We wish them luck and much carefree hunting in the days to come. </p>

<p>Also exiting the competition in the usual way were Dredpok, the level 7 Dwarven Paladin via a Greater Orc's Broadsword. A pair of Burghal Gnomes Wizards also met their end. Scurf was eaten by a Werebear and Ratsil chopped down by a Wood Wight. It's been a rough few weeks for the Gnomes of late, but they're a determined bunch as Rattas the Burghal Gnome Wizard takes up his brother's (figurative) runestaff to tread on in his place. Also joining the ranks is Sindaras the Sylvankind Paladin and Eroland the Giantkin Empath. Finally, another of the Maza clan has risen to join the HARDCORE, going by the name of Maazikeen the 11th of her line. The Dark Elf Wizard is F2P as always and is tearing up the charts as we speak.</p>

<p>That'll do it for this week's roster update. Until next time, HARDCORE.</p></div></article><article id="post-8314" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, January 22nd, 2018, 2:06:33 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The wiki has been updated with the new retirement rules: *    All HARDCORE competitors who have not yet been eliminated from the competition have the option to retire their character. Retirement allows the character to exit the competition, enabling the player to enter new competitors to the competition without having to delete their previous one. Retirement must be announced PRIOR to the HARDCORE character's elimination, and is irreversible. Leaderboard positions earned by the retired character shall remain in place as if they had been eliminated and any prizes won up to that point are theirs to keep.</p></div></article><article id="post-8330" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, January 24th, 2018, 10:43:40 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The wiki has had a few updates:</p>

<p>The first is purely cosmetic and involves reorganizing the leaderboards for the sake of clarity. Let me know if you spot any errors or inconsistencies.</p>

<p>The 2nd is the creation of the collapsible category, <em>"HARDCORE - Inactive Adventurers"</em>. This category contains characters who have not been seen in the lands for at least 1 month's time. <strong><em>These characters are all still registered in the competition and nothing other than their listing on the Wiki has changed.</em></strong> If they are spotted in game they will be moved back onto the active roster. This change was made simply to make my life easier when parsing information on the wiki. If you feel you've been put on this list incorrectly, or ANY information is incomplete or incorrect, please let me know via the forums, Discord, or in game via Sulikfor on Lnet.</p></div></article><article id="post-8337" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 26th, 2018, 3:24:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Cave Gnoll Iced out Eroland today -- standby for round 10</p></div></article><article id="post-8338" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 26th, 2018, 3:26:21 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Roleric...but what to be...</p></div></article><article id="post-8339" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Losus</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 26th, 2018, 3:35:00 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Roleric - Forest Gnome - Monk - Landing - death details to follow shortly lmao</p></div></article><article id="post-8340" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Doug</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, January 26th, 2018, 4:41:35 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@losus Yes!

He was caught unawares while foraging herbs for a bounty task and was unable to resist the sexy undead's spells. Here's hoping his successor Lachon the Elven Bard avoids a similar fate. Also losing his life this past week was Eroland the Giantkin Empath, who was cut down by Cave Gnolls. In our final ins and outs of the week we have added Ruleric the Human Ranger to the ranks. Wish him well.</p>

<p>That's it for this week. Until next time.</p></div></article><article id="post-8385" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, February 6th, 2018, 8:25:21 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Sixteen is a cursed number for the Maazi clan. This curse afflicted poor Maazikeen this week as she was brought down by a Forest Troll. 16 is the highest level the clan has ever reached, just as it was for Mazikean before her. I pray that this curse is broken with the rise of the next generation of the Mazi clan who makes their debute next week. Also losing their life was poor Ruleric, who got licked by a Leaper at level 5. Joining the ranks for the week are Frazler the Human Ranger, off to a strong start and already level 10, the Dwarven Sorcerer Egard (F2P), and Kros the Burghal Gnome Monk. </p>

<p>The January Seasonal Competition has drawn to a close. HARDCORE had 18 competitors that month, with Maazikeen and Mazakeene taking the top overall and F2P spots at levels 16 and 15 respectively. Rattas placed 2nd at level 15 (now 16) and Owsom took second in F2P with a level 5 showing. Owsom decided to donate his winnings to The Imperiled Few's coffers, which was a generous and most appreciated offer. February's Seasonal competition is in full swing, so jump on in and be automatically enrolled for a chance at Fortune and Glory.</p></div></article></div></body></html>
