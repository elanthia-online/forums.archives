<p>.</p>

<h2><strong>Rangers:</strong></h2>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Rangers:</strong>
- No specific DEV at this time.</p>

<p><strong>620:</strong>
- They can evaluate whether it should work above brig.</p>

<p><strong>Player Request - Option for 635 to be player friendly.</strong>
- It would be possible with a target limit, based upon skills.</p>

<p><strong>630:</strong>
- Suggest ideas for new ambients/actions (Need messaging)
- Or submit to GM Keios</p>

<p>.</p>

<h2><strong>Wizards:</strong></h2>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Anything new with Wizards?</strong>
- No major updates coming
- Minor updates coming soon</p>

<p><strong>525:</strong>
- Something they want to update to make useful.
- General theme will stay the same.
- GM may "tackle" it soon.</p>

<p><strong>920 Updates:</strong>
- Chance to "anchor" a specific famililar to always get that type of familiar.
- Something to consider.</p>

<p><strong>8x,9x,10x Potions:</strong>
- Will not be available through alchemy
- Maybe under version 2.0</p>

<p>.</p>

<h2><strong>Clerics:</strong></h2>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Combining 309/315:</strong>
- Wouldn't happen without a reason to do it, and a spell to fill the slot.</p>

<p><strong>320:</strong>
- Need a good idea for the slot.</p>

<p><strong>330:</strong>
- Won't become an innate skill unless there is a good spell to fill the slot.</p>

<p><strong>New Cleric bolt spell:</strong>
- They do have an idea, Estild would like to see a 200's bolt spell, low priority.</p>

<p>.</p>

<h2><strong>Paladins</strong></h2>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>1650:</strong>
- Not ready to talk about it.
- Mostly been coded.
- Next couple months.</p>

<p><strong>Zealot + Hurling:</strong>
- Possible to make it work.
- But Paladins are not seen as hurlers.</p>

<p><strong>Zealot:</strong>
- May gain an option to no longer affect the whole group.</p>

<p><strong>1618:</strong>
- Doesn't add damage padding to UAC.
- Probably a bug.</p>

<p>.</p>

<h2><strong>Sorcerers:</strong></h2>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>709:</strong>
- When cast and it tags everything in REIM - It's a bug.</p>

<p><strong>Minor Summoning:</strong>
- will not be updated to attack.
- Meant to be a utility spell.</p>

<p><strong>Alchemy Recipe:</strong>
- Much more expensive to create a chalk (740)
- Will look at reviewing the recipe</p>

<p><strong>750:</strong>
- No news, no design.  Submit ideas.</p>

<p>.</p>

<h2><strong>Empaths:</strong></h2>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Cry for Help:</strong>
- Looking at replacing cry for help.
- Some stuff in the works, focused towards healing, creating more incentive to heal.</p>

<p><strong>Troll's Blood:</strong>
- Cast option that wouldn't affect all so no scars</p>

<p>.</p>

<h2><strong>MISC:</strong></h2>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>116:</strong>
- Bowels, Varunar -- Cannot be located within those areas.
- Post areas that don't work so they can evaluate areas that are prevented, but shouldn't be.
- They will not allow 204 to be overrode via lore.</p>

<p><strong>Weighting/Padding changes:</strong>
- Don't expect blessable claidhmores.
- Might be possible with "Auction" quality
- Don't expect bless or eblade to work on these items</p>

<p><strong>Minor Mental Spells:</strong>
- 1212: No DEV - Lots of work to override all scripts
- 1235: No DEV</p>

<p><strong>Updating Weapon Bases/Armor Bases to allow greater variety because of improvements:</strong>
- Not against it, but yet another thing to work on.</p>

<p><strong>Create your own scrolls:</strong>
- Already have 420</p>

<p><strong>How do you decide when to open the test server?</strong>
- When they need to test something big.
- They don't want to leave it open so we break their formulas.</p>

<p><strong>UAC &amp; Berserk:</strong>
- Not a quick and easy update.
- They will consider it</p>

<p><strong>Hurling Updates:</strong>
- No work on it
- On a backlist</p>

<p><strong>Shield Specializations:</strong>
- Can be reviewed, especially the ones that aren't used much.</p>

<p><strong>Fusion:</strong>
- Mario Question
- There will be no more extraction using the old system, all future extraction will be 2.0</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Hunting Grounds:</strong>
- Will not be permanent</p>

<p><strong>Post-Cap Hunting Areas:</strong>
- Post-Cap Dev goals prior to hunting areas.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Cap Dev Goals:</strong>
- You would get "character points" to spend towards abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Disarm:</strong>
- GM responsible for it is hoping to get back into it soon.
- Can still be disarmed, but will not be permanent loss</p>

<p><strong>Artisan Skill Roundtime:</strong>
- They can consider reducing it</p>

<p><strong>What does balance mean at a high level to you?</strong>
- Should be strengths/weaknesses</p>

<p><strong>Transportation System:</strong>
- Estild plans to make it a top priority after Simucon.
- All teleportation spells will be updated, expect additional training to unlock.</p>

<p><strong>Mining/Smelting?</strong>
- GM-Coase's project - not high priority</p>

<p><strong>Zul Logoth:</strong>
- Any further DEV?
- Worlds team question  (Worlds team said no)</p>

<p><strong>Unable to determine TD on gear outside of combat:</strong>
- Can look at updating loresinging to provide the information
- Maybe sorcerer, but would prefer loresinging</p>

<p><strong>Loresinging doesn't show temporary abilities correctly.</strong>
- Loresinging should be able to tell all the properties of an item</p>

<p><strong>GOS Warcamp Clerics:</strong>
- They cast interdiction
- Can look at duration reduction</p>

<p><strong>Rift Hunting: (liches)</strong>
- Can look at making lichbane talismans not be stripped.</p></div></article><article id="post-86" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, August 6th, 2017, 12:24:12 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Post-cap growth would be awesome.

I'm absolutely not opposed to it, but within the capped community, I couldn't imagine trying to implement a hunting ground assuming characters have 15m XP and X character points allocated, while not being overly difficulty, or a joke by 20m XP... balance is a difficult concept to strike in this game.  So... if we don't have some super higher hunting grounds outside of invasions, is this just more inflation to make Sanctum, OTF, etc, just easier hunting?</p></div></article><article id="post-92" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Ordim</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 7th, 2017, 8:15:54 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>To answer your direct question, yes, of course, it makes that easier. They did bring this up and flat out said "expect to see tougher critters to compensate", how that will play out is yet to be seen. 
What they should really figure out how to code is something like the Nephilim challenges/rifts in Diablo 3. Something that you either pre-select the difficulty of or scales with your performance as you go through it. I can imagine that this might be impossible (mostly the dynamic scaling part), but pre-creating some cap +5, cap +10, cap +20 instances with monsters to fit should be a normal cycle of design, code, tweak to get reasonable. 
Thus the constant back and forth of balance begins as more features and weapons and such are added and the game becomes easier. Gemstone has something that, while not everyone will agree, sets it apart from more static games like Diablo in that even once you become the lawnmower of monsters you can still interact with lots of people in a unique fashion that might change from time to time. That whole Role Playing part of the mud that people tend to put aside.</p></div></article><article id="post-93" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, August 7th, 2017, 8:25:29 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>The entire Dev roundtable was kinda painful to watch.

Estild basically responded to everything with either a "no", or a "maybe that could be looked at", with the exception of the transportation system and inducing empaths to heal more.  He also somewhat contradicted what Wyrom said in his SoE address with regards to weighting and padding (or at least that's how it sounded to me at the time).  I had been hoping for a lot more from this RoundTable, but that may have just been my preconceptions.</p>

<p>That being said, I did appreciate that they were willing to have an on-record conversation about it at all.

<p>@ArchSenex noted exactly what the issue is here in his last post in this thread.  We have no interest in filling empty spell slots just so we can say that slot is now filled.  We'd rather wait until we have a good and worthy idea.  The reason a lot of answers are "something we'll discuss" during Q&amp;A is because there is a Development team, not a single person.  I was the ranking Dev GM at SimuCon, so I get to field the questions, but unless it's a minor idea/request, I'm not going to be making snapshot decisions on the fly.  I instead take the feedback and discuss it with the rest of the team after SimuCon.</p>

<p>We're <strong>always</strong> open to ideas for new spell ideas, updates to existing spells, and pretty much every aspect of GemStone.</p>

<p>Something akin to "Hi all, thanks for coming out.  To give a bit of an upfront presentation, I'm GM Estild, I'm the head of Dev, and I'm currently working on Travel System 2.0 {with a little bit of info about that}, GM Mestys is currently exploring the possibility of re-running Droughtman's Maze {with some words about the difficulties that would present}, and GM Keios is working on getting UAC to interact appropriately with Berserk {with some explanation about how that's a huge deal}.  Other members of the team who are NOT here with us {with snide joke about them slacking off} include GM Bob, who is working on X, GM Jim, who is working on Y, and GM Dick, who... to be honest I'm not sure what he's working on, but feel free to email him at GS4-Dick@play.net and ask him!  With that out of the way, let's open it up to questions!"</p>

<p>Again, I appreciate the willingness to even HAVE the roundtable, and have it streamed.  It's always interesting to peek behind the curtain.  But the way this was presented left me feeling a bit like there wasn't a lot of Dev going on, in general... and that it was largely due to lack of ideas.  I feel relatively certain that's not the case (given how comparatively robust the game is lately), but would have liked a bit more insight.</p></div></article><article id="post-257" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 7:45:20 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>It kinda felt like we were trying to get more info from an NPC and just asking the wrong questions.</p>

Second, that is a perfectly fair point and position to have, it should just be communicated from the get go. As Ozymandius offers, a general opening of "Hey, heres some general areas we are working on right now because we feel the game lacks/needs/wants X based on Y" at least gives people an idea of what they should focus their feedback scope on. 
I've only been around for a little over a year but it seemed like a good amount of questions were ones that come up frequently enough. Complex (or otherwise already nixed) systems like mining/smelting, savants, come up over and over. I think you helped people understand a lot better the direction with one simple sentence "I'd rather dedicate time to savants over guild skills". That gives us more accurate expectations so that there should be less disappointment or animosity when someones favored area is not focused on etc.</p></div></article><article id="post-262" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 7:53:57 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@sabotage said in <a href="/post/257">Simucon 2017: DEV Roundtable</a>:</p>

<p>That's understandable and was one of the driving forces for me to first attend SimuCon back in 2005, as I too wanted to know what was happening in the game and what was planned for the future.  However, since then, we've shifted away from providing too many details about projects that are still in development.  There are absolutely many things that are being worked on right now, that we did not mention at SimuCon.  However, we continually get burned by the fact we've announced things 10 years ago that still haven't been implemented, even though we've specifically stated we have no immediate plans to work on such projects (e.g. Savants).  That internal policy isn't my decision, but I am bound by it nonetheless.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the roundtables were much more formal this year than in the last 10 years.  We use to just gather around a table and engage in discussion, instead of it just being a Q&amp;A.

<p>Development does work on some microtransactions, mostly for individual items in the SimuCoin Store (guild night passes, attunement resets, etc - all of which are rather minor to implement from our side), but it is a significant minority compared to the work that goes into things like Duskruin, Ebon Gate, and other events.  That work is done by the Events team.  Ebon Gate moving to a different monetary system has absolutely no impact on development for new spells, combat maneuvers, or professions in general.</p></div></article><article id="post-370" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Flimbo</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 12:56:56 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@whirlin said in <a href="/post/367">Simucon 2017: DEV Roundtable</a>:</p>

<p>The Hero Engine was a last ditch attempt to salvage something from dumping money into a hole for a decade, and Bioshock did use it to create SW:TOR, yes. I can almost guarantee you from a development standpoint that zero dollars were in the black for Simutronics on that one. I also purchased a copy for $100 out of curiosity. It was not a bad engine. Don't want to say that at all, but Heroes Journey was vaporware, and nobody can deny that .</p>

<p>I'm not ignoring anything, but what I've gathered from this thread is that most things that players have asked about are not being actively worked on, and that the dev team is tight lipped about what actually is being worked on.</p>

<p>My fear, and it is a legitimate one, is that what is being worked on is largely more microtransaction systems, and I will retain that fear until the development team comes out and says that that is not the case.</p></div></article><article id="post-371" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Vishra</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 1:04:51 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@flimbo By all accounts- the Hero Engine was a successful revenue stream. </p>

<p>@vishra Yeah that part's the only bit that made me put the word "almost" in there. I don't know how much of its development was actually volunteer work, but it was developed at least twice from scratch over a period of a decade (They scrapped it once at least in 98 or 99 and started over).

<p>Totally agree with all of this. One of the reasons I love the gem cutter pattern customization is that not only does it help with chrisms and sorting gems is that it also allows us to create our own items like warrior sheaths, shoes, and I believe lockpicks if you ever manage to finish lockmastery. I would love to be able to make more things myself instead of standing in line waiting desperately to get picked by a spinner that never lands on me. Also if we could create more of our own things, then the GM's could do more roleplaying, development, what have you.</p></div></article><article id="post-383" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">GS4Menos</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, August 8th, 2017, 1:22:49 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@Estild </p>

<p>FWIW, I really liked the format of the roundtable this year in general and your fielding of the questions in specific.  Of course, this is from the perspective of a stream viewer and not an attending player.  I am not sure I like it more than the older version, but it was a good watch.  I would of course have loved additional details (and more overall things covered/coming out), but I got way more out of the DEV roundtable than I did the worlds one.</p>

<p>I am probably also being biased by my two biggest dev hopes both making it on the list of things covered (Paladins and post cap).</p>
