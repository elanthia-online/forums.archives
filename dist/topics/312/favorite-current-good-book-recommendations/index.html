To that end, I thought people could share book recommendations / their favorite books, maybe with a blurb about each.  If this ends up largely self-serving, I'm good with that.  I want recommendations for ME first and foremost.</p>

<p>But to get, sometimes you have to give first.</p>

<p>(Some of the) Best Books I've Ever Read:
* The Watchers, by Dean Koontz.  This is my litmus test.  If anyone reads this and doesn't love it, they clearly have no soul.
* The Name of the Wind / The Wise Man's Fear - The Kingkiller Chronicles, by Patrick Rothfuss.  This is an incredible saga, unfinished though it still is to this point.  It's the epitome of the fantasy genre in my mind.  I'm dearly awaiting Book 3, but have read these two many, many times.
* 14, by Peter Clines.  There's good horror (Steven King), but then there's a pure <em>thriller</em>.  That's what 14 is.  Most books have a series of plot or thematic climbs and falls.  You build to a miniature peak, then come back down, only to rise to the next peak.  This book doesn't do that.  It's a steady, steep climb farther than you'd think was possible.
* The Dresden Files, by Jim Butcher.  Noir fantasy with a fantastic sense of humor, action in spades, fantastic characters that develop over time... I can't say enough good things about this series.
* The Nightlord Books, by Garon Whited.  Realistic journal-style approach to a Vampire story, crossed with the sort of world-building that you might expect out of a Grand Strategy Game.  (Incredibly) long novels, each of them, and they get a bit tedious in parts, but it's a fascinating journey all the same.
* The Hellequin Chronicles, by Steve McHugh.  The first book is NOT how the series goes.  It's a one-off, with a completely different self-contained approach from the rest of the series.  But it's a great storyline all the same.  I'd summarize, but it would ruin the first book if I gave anything away.  Suffice it to say:  Great action, entertaining magic system, political intrigue (of sorts), believable bad guys and drama.  Good reads.
* Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.  If you haven't read this, you should.  It's fantastically funny, smart, witty, crass, crude, irreverent, silly, tender, and an incredible amount of fun.  It's a light(ish) read, and make sure you get a version that includes the footnotes.
* The King's Dark Tidings series, by Kel Kade (AKA the Rezkin books).  These have a serious problem with suspension of disbelief.  The basic premise they ask you to swallow right up front is very, VERY hard to stomach.  Once you choke it down, though, these are fantastically entertaining books.  There's so much backhanded humor woven into the interactions between the main character and his companions that it's a joy to read, and re-read.  The action scenes are all fun, and there's a fairly strong plot rolling through the series.  As I said, though, that initial premise sticks in the craw at first.
* The Super Powereds series, by Drew Hayes.  This is a series of books set in a world where super heroes are real.  A character-driven series, this is a relentlessly entertaining read.  Genuine good guys and bad guys, betrayal, tragedy, and a setup where almost NOTHING is what it seems.  Currently re-reading these, and enjoying them more than I did the first time through, which is saying something.</p>

<p>Note about the above:
Clearly I prefer series to standalone novels.  This is largely because I read so much.  It's comforting to have a whole series waiting on me when I start out.  I prefer fantasy, but not too serious fantasy (No George RR Martin for me).  I like action, I prefer a male protagonist, humor is a good thing, as is sexuality if it's not too overstated.</p>

<p>My biggest preference, though, is characters acting TOTALLY believably to an incredibly unbelievable scenario.  14 is a great example of that.  Events spiral way (WAY) out of control, but the people involved react exactly how "real" people would.  I'm a sucker for that above almost all else.</p>

<p>Also of note:  I listen to almost everything I 'read' as an audiobook.  If you recommend something that isn't available on Audible (or elsewhere) as an audiobook, it might get added to my list, but my physical reading of books is <em>much</em> slower than what I listen to (and there's a decent queue of them already).</p>

<p>So, if you're willing, post up some of your favorites, maybe with a blurb about what drew you to them.  Maybe we can help each other find a new favorite book/series!</p></div></article><article id="post-3017" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017, 10:40:26 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@0zymandius  I'm enjoying The Painted Man series by Peter Brett.  It is still on going, but I think there is only 1 book left.  They are fairly short reads.</p>

<p>I liked the different approach to magic and the characters.  I'm lazy so here is an internet synopsis. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As darkness falls after sunset, the corelings rise—demons who possess supernatural powers and burn with a consuming hatred of humanity. For hundreds of years the demons have terrorized the night, slowly culling the human herd that shelters behind magical wards—symbols of power whose origins are lost in myth and whose protection is terrifyingly fragile. It was not always this way. Once, men and women battled the corelings on equal terms, but those days are gone. Night by night the demons grow stronger, while human numbers dwindle under their relentless assault. Now, with hope for the future fading, three young survivors of vicious demon attacks will dare the impossible, stepping beyond the crumbling safety of the wards to risk everything in a desperate quest to regain the secrets of the past. Together, they will stand against the night</p>

<p>I recommend it, as well.</p>

<p>Also - the audiobook versions of the Dresden Files are pretty amazing. Narrated by James Marsters (Spike from Buffy). He does an awesome job voicing everything.</p>

<p>Other books I've enjoyed:
- Mercy Thompson series by Patricia Briggs
- Outlander series by Diana Gabboldon (sp - can never spell her last name correctly!)
- Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card (though the later books in the series get a bit odd, the first one is amazing.)

<p>I couldn't agree more with this.</p>

<p>Also, if you're an audiobook aficionado, then the Kingkiller books become even MORE of a must-read/listen.  The narrator for those is simply incredible.</p></div></article><article id="post-3021" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017, 10:55:42 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@0zymandius - great list!! </p>

<p>I recently finished American Gods, and now I'm on to the Dresden Files. I'd like to recommend Robin Hobb, particularly the Farseer trilogy and the Tawny Man trilogy.</p>

<p>Edit: I see you've recommended Patrick Rothfuss (one of my favs!). Rothfuss and Hobb are huge fans of each other, if that helps give you any indication of Hobb's talents.

<ul>
<li>The Gentleman Bastard Sequence, by Scott Lynch. The elevator pitch of this series would be "Gritty Ocean's Eleven in a Steampunkish Venice". Unlike Ocean's Eleven, the main characters are generally not cruising through the challenges that face them, and I enjoy the writing, making it really enjoyable to read through. Three of seven books are out, and the fourth is out sometime soonish?</li>
<li>The Expanse series, by James S. A. Corey. Fairly hard sci-fi about a future in which mankind can traverse/settle parts of the solar system. If you're familiar with Attack on Titan, this is a series which has no brakes, and tends to keep raising the stakes. There's also a TV series, and both are really enjoyable.</li>
<li>Codex Alera by Jim Butcher. Fantasy book series written in to a challenge when Jim Butcher claimed that good writing can make any story idea work. Someone challenged him to write a book combining Pokemon with the Lost Roman Legion, and it turns out he can in fact make it work.</li>
<li>Mistborn series, by Brandon Sanderson. Fantasy series set in a world in which the bad guy won, and civilization has evolved under his rule for a very long time. The magic system in this series is very interesting, based on people who are capable of consuming and using specific metals to produce particular effects.</li>
<li>Discworld Series, by Terry Pratchett. Ridiculous, hilarious, British satire wrapped up inside a fantasy series about a disc carried on the back of a giant turtle. There are a ton of books in this series, to the point that the series is broken down into different sub-series depending on which set of characters are the central protagonists of a given book.</li>

<p>If only Rothfuss could be as efficient with writing time as Hobb. She wrote the whole Fitz and Fool trilogy in the same time that Rothfuss has not finished book 3.

<p>American Gods is incredible.  It's the least entertaining 'great' book I've ever read.  Which isn't to say it's not entertaining (it is).  But it's so massive, and relentlessly obscure, that I was never really sure where I stood with regards to my comprehension of what was going on.  For all that, a stunningly well-written book.</p></div></article><article id="post-3028" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017, 11:15:00 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@allereli I'm also holding off on Assassin's Fate, but only because I was really excited to start the Dresden Files. To be honest, I think Hobb has lost just a touch of her magic. Her later books aren't holding my interest as much as the first Farseer trilogies. And YES, Rothfuss needs to just...just finish the damn book. But as an aside, I love his Twitch channel. Dude gets really grumpy and it's entertaining to watch.</p>

<p>@0zymandius - I really enjoyed American Gods as well. I felt like I needed a better background in lore and mythology to really understand the characters though. I was often left feeling that I was missing some greater point or sentiment that Gaiman was attempting to convey.</p></div></article><article id="post-3033" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017, 11:31:54 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I enjoy the Mercy Thompson series, Mostly because it's a series about the supernatural that DOESN'T sound like the author spends every night masturbating to fantasies about how amazing X group is, and they'd be able to totally dominate every other supernatural out there.

<p>See... I need someone to root for.  I need a hero (cue bad 80s music).  Television shows, movies, or books without a clear-cut hero that I can root for (no matter how flawed they might otherwise be) do almost nothing for me.</p>

<p>The clearest delineation I can draw is one my wife coined for me a while back.  My absolute perfect narrative is Die Hard.  Everyman in WAY over his head against impossible odds guts his way through the situation by doing the 'right thing' no matter what.  One can easily draw a VERY clear line from that to Dresden... and that's my absolute preferred narrative.</p></div></article><article id="post-3043" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017, 12:05:36 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@hjfudge said in <a href="/post/3041">Favorite / Current Good book recommendations</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Old Man's War by John Scalzi
This is an interesting premise that I really enjoyed. It is more sci-fi than fantasy, of course. Basically when you hit 75 years old on Earth, you can join a mysterious armed forces for off-planet colony guard duty in which rumor has it they have special tech to make old people fit again. This has more than one book, too, though I've only read one more.</p></li>
<li><p>"Magic 2.0" series by Scott Meyer
This starts off with "Off to be the Wizard".
It's another interesting premise, but with more humor injected into it. You may find more humor in it if you have a little knowledge of programming, as basic premise is someone finds a way to actually affect things in the real world using some sort of shady backdoor program he finds online. Time travel happens and hijinx ensues. This also has more than one book and I have had a blast reading all of them, (I sort of discovered this series through one of Audible's sales and I haven't regretted it.)</p></li>
<li><p>"Ready Player One" by Ernist Cline

<p>Another book series I really enjoyed:</p>

<p>Heroe's Die by Matthew Stover - An excellent blend of sci-fi and fantasy with some interesting concepts that I like. A great story and a great main character.</p></div></article><article id="post-3187" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">0zymandius</div><div class="timestamp">Thursday, August 24th, 2017, 1:20:47 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@livderaderalleur said in <a href="/post/3060">Favorite / Current Good book recommendations</a>:</p>

<p>I haven't read this one in particular, but I did dive into the LitRPG subgenre a bit and found a couple of enjoyable reads.  The Way of the Shaman books (by Vasily Mahanenko) and Awaken Online books (by Travis Bagwell) are both good reads.  Awaken Online was what first put the bug in my ear to come back to Gemstone, as so many of the small things that are referenced in it are so familiar to GS players.</p></div></article><article id="post-3275" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Tisket</div><div class="timestamp">Friday, August 25th, 2017, 2:09:49 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I too listen to Audible recordings, usually while driving or working around the house.

<p>Heh.  I ABSOLUTELY tend to prefer longer books, to get the most out of my credits.  That's where the Nightlord series really shines for me.  It's entertaining all on its own, but the books average around 40 hours or so in length.</p>

<p>There's a 'size matters' joke in here somewhere, but I'll leave it alone.</p>

<p>Theft of Swords added to wishlist, thanks!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
