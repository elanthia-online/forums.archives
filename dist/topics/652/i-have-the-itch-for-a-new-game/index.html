<p>Game looks amazing! Also I'll admit, I'm simply terrible at the stealth kill style games like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed.</p></div></article><article id="post-7242" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 5th, 2017, 11:00:45 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Have you played Witcher 3?

<p>Witcher 3: Oh yeah - I should have added that one to my favs list!</p>

<p>Nier: Automata - I have a buddy who loves that game. This is the same buddy who convinced me to give FFXV a try, and they are now recommending Persona 5 to me (which looks very intriguing). They may turn me into a JRPG fan yet, haha.</p></div></article><article id="post-7246" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Sabotage</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 5th, 2017, 11:14:06 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I was going to say Persona 5 but you said not an anime fan.</p></div></article><article id="post-7247" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 5th, 2017, 11:14:24 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@erous </p>

<p>The Last of Us: I've been overlooking this game because I've never been a fan of the zombie genre, but looking at the reviews it is clearly so much more than the same old tropes. I will be adding this one to my buy list!</p></div></article><article id="post-7248" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Evarin</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 5th, 2017, 11:36:48 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@maylan said in <a href="/post/7238">I have the itch for a new game</a>:</p>

<p>If you're willing to try something outside of your comfort zone, I would suggest the Dark Souls series. Deep lore, but you need to search for it. The excellent Bloodborne is a standalone game on the PS4 that would give you an idea if it is your cup of tea.</p></div></article><article id="post-7259" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Maylan</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 5th, 2017, 8:29:34 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Okay I am currently downloading The Last of Us, remastered edition!</p></div></article><article id="post-7265" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Erous</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 5th, 2017, 9:52:28 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Oh snap!</p></div></article><article id="post-7271" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">ArchSenex</div><div class="timestamp">Sunday, November 5th, 2017, 11:18:41 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Persona 5 is a great way to lose a couple weeks of your life.</p></div></article><article id="post-7272" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Necios</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 6th, 2017, 1:45:01 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>@maylan Just started Until Dawn and it's incredible!

<p>Until Dawn is Awesome.  Really loved that one.</p>

<p>If either of you haven't tried Beyond: Two Souls, it's also great and in similar vein.</p>

<p>Hidden Agenda, released recently, is good, but much shorter (designed for a 2 hour play session).  Great with friends.</p></div></article><article id="post-7278" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Tykus</div><div class="timestamp">Monday, November 6th, 2017, 9:39:28 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I know you said ps4 but I always recommend EVE Oline.

So far I find it challenging and unsettling. I also cried during the opening scene, so I can tell I'm in for some feels with this game.</p>

<p>When I finish that I think I'll move onto Persona 5, then look into Until Dawn and Beyond: Two Souls. Then maybe by this time the price will have dropped on Hellblade. That should keep me occupied for a looooong time. So I've gone from having nothing to buy, to too many games. THANKS GUYS!</p></div></article></div></body></html>
