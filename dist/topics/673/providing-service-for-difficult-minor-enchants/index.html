<p>Mage near cap and has a build is of 2x MIU, 2x AS, 2xHP, 101 EMC,  currently 134 wizard ranks pushing right up to 150, already a better enchanter than most standard mage builds. My inventory alone has given me vast experience with enhancive, padded, sancted weapons and armors, but I have done work for others as well, including God Auction enhancives and masterful padded with t5 ensorcelled armors. I have done extensive work following every recent change and in particular working with enhancive and padded/weighted items. </p>

<p>The service is simple. I will take anything you have that can be done to 4x (if possible). I can provide beforehand reads to ascertain difficulty. If the item can't be read at 4x yet because it is 0x and it gets too hard by 4x, I will provide a read and assessment of whether or not I believe it can be done and what it will take with each ascending enchant. If I can't get it all the way to 4x but can get it later with more ranks and training, I absolutely will. I doubt this happens often, but just so you know. </p>

<p>The fee is 1m for ANYTHING 0-4x.  You provide the cost of special temper potions, or the temper potions themselves in addition (I am not worried about the standard potions for basic enchant) . I will lay out exactly what is required at time of agreement. I can tell you Ayvaneh potions used for enhancive usually run 225k and have 5 pours. You need 1 pour per temper. I potion would get you from 1x to 3x, for example, 2 would get you from 0-4x. padding/weighting/sighting alone take NO special temper potion. Resists do not matter for temper. Ensorcel does not matter for temper.</p>

<p>Leave me a message here or contact me IG (Arshwikk) for service.</p></div></article><article id="post-7507" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Arshwikk</div><div class="timestamp">Tuesday, November 14th, 2017, 5:54:50 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>I've gotten a read to take a fishspine (15 points of weighting) from 4-5x and should be able to take any standard fishspine from 0-4x no problem, for example.</p></div></article><article id="post-7625" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Arshwikk</div><div class="timestamp">Saturday, November 25th, 2017, 9:50:12 AM</div></div><div class="content"><p>Bump (this is an ongoing service)</p></div></article><article id="post-8333" class="roboto"><div class="info"><div class="author">Leto</div><div class="timestamp">Wednesday, January 24th, 2018, 11:29:08 PM</div></div><div class="content"><p>My TWC build has 2 wickedly curved faenor waraxes that I would like to see about getting up to 4x.
